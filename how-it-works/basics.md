# Basics

{% hint style="success" %}

:tada: Welcome!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Open Collective&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
* **Open Collective Inc**. is the **platform** that OCF operates on.&#x20;
  * Open Collective has their own [homepage](https://www.opencollective.com), [budget](https://opencollective.com/opencollective#category-ABOUT), and [documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/). These docs you're currently reading are a pared down version to relay information that is specific to OCF.
* **OCF (**Open Collective **Foundation)** is a charitable **** [**fiscal host**](../what-we-offer/fiscal-hosting.md) who uses the Open Collective platform
{% endhint %}

For an overview of [using the Open Collective platform](https://opencollective.com/how-it-works), check out their[ documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com). It has a ton of great information about features like the [transparent budget](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/budget), customizing an [Collective profile](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/customize-collective), [tiers, goals](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/tiers-goals), and other tools now at your disposal.&#x20;

## Receiving Funds

Our documentation includes information for how people can contribute to your Collective: Feel free to share this [Financial Contributions overview](financial-contributions/) with your contributors!

## Submitting Expenses

Using funds from your Collective’s budget is simple:

1. Someone submits an [expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses).
   * There are 2 main types of Expenses: (For all payout options available, check [our Payouts page](payouts.md).)
     * [**Reimbursements** ](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#reimbursements)
     * ****[**Invoices**](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#invoices)****
2. An Collective [admin](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/core-contributors#roles) (someone on your team) approves it.
3. OCF's team reviews it (confirms that the expense meets requirements e.g. having a valid receipt, amounts match).
4. They get [paid](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/payouts#what-payment-methods-do-you-support-for-withdrawals).

{% hint style="info" %}
Collective admins can [set an expense policy](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/expense-policy) to give guidance to expense submitters.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### How submitting & paying out expenses works:

#### **Expense** payments may relate to either:&#x20;

1. an [**Invoice**](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#invoices) **** for work completed for the Collective;&#x20;
   * _Invoices_ are used to pay people for work completed or their goods/services.&#x20;
   * Within the _invoice_ option, you can either upload your own invoice, or you can create one directly on the platform. You will be able to detail what the services/goods are, and can include multiple items&#x20;
   * When someone uses invoices, they are treated as an independent contractor. If earnings exceed $600 in a year, they will be automatically issued a 1099 tax form to fill out per IRS regulations. (_Reimbursements_ do not trigger the 1099 form). More info about taxes [here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/tax-information).
2. or a [**Reimbursement** ](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#reimbursements)for purchases made on behalf of the Collective.
   * _Reimbursements_ are used to pay people (often volunteers) back when they have made purchases for the group - in these cases, receipts are required so that we can ensure the requested amount matches the purchased amount in order to approve the reimbursement.

{% hint style="success" %}
* Individuals and organizations can request payment from an Collective by [submitting an expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses).&#x20;
* Collective admins also have the option of drafting an expense and then [**sending an invitation** to someone else to complete and submit it](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#inviting-a-third-party-to-submit-an-expense).
  * _This is a great option for those admins who know already know exactly how much they want to pay/reimburse someone, and just want to invite them to the platform._
* Sometimes a **third type of expense, "Request a Grant"** will appear on an Collective's page. This is because that Collective has submitted a grant proposal in order to be able to offer grants. More info [here](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/about-grantmaking).
{% endhint %}

#### OCF uses a Double-Approval Process to pay out expenses:&#x20;

1. Once submitted, expenses need to first be [approved by Collective admins](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/approving-expenses) and then,
2. Expenses are processed and paid out by Open Collective Foundation biweekly on **Mondays and Thursdays**. :earth\_asia: _Our finance team works across multiple time zones, which may mean transaction payments do not process until later in the day._

{% hint style="info" %}
OCF can [pay out funds](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses#by-what-method-can-i-get-paid) via PayPal and electronic bank transfer via Transferwise.&#x20;

Make sure to review the [Expenses and Getting Paid](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses) section of Open Collective’s documentation for a full overview of the process.

If your Collective would like to pay out funds to individuals who do not have bank account access/PayPal, please review our [Cash Assistance Policy](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/cash-assistance-policy).

Also check our [Third-Party Fundraising Tools](financial-contributions/third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits/) and our [Outside Accounts Policy](policies/outside-accounts-policy.md) pages for info about how OCF works with other giving platforms (e.g. [Venmo, CashApp,](financial-contributions/third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits/#venmo-and-cash-app) [GoFundMe](financial-contributions/third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits/#third-party-tools))
