# How to Apply

## **Before you apply:**

1. Read through our [full documentation](https://docs.opencollective.foundation) and [FAQs](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/faq) and review the [Terms of Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/getting-started/terms) (a.k.a. our Terms and Conditions - when you submit your application, you will tick a box to agree to these. This is our Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement/MOA)
2. Ensure that you are [eligible](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/getting-started/eligibility) for fiscal hosting with Open Collective Foundation and are familiar with the Open Collective [Community Guidelines](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/community-guidelines)
3. Be familiar with the the [Restrictions & Limitations](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations#restrictions-and-limitations) of our program
4. Review our [Cash Assistance Policy](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/cash-assistance-policy), [Outside Entities Policy](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/outside-entities-policy), and [Outside Accounts Policy](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/outside-accounts-policy) to ensure that OCF's fiscal hosting is right for you
5. Review our [fee structure](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/fees)
6. Have at least 2 community members ready to add as [admins](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/core-contributors). Admins have full permissions to change settings, approve expenses, and make financial contributions from the budget balance of your initiative. _**Applications with less than 2 admins will not be accepted.**_

### :bulb: A**s a reminder:**

* If your initiative is hosted by the Foundation, donations made through Open Collective are **tax-deductible** for your financial contributors.
* You retain ownership of all your initiative's **intellectual property**.
* We will hold and manage funds on behalf of your initiative and we won't use them for anything else.
* If you want to enter into an agreement with anyone else, such as a contract with a vendor or providing a specific service to a sponsor, **you need to get our permission**, because legally the agreement would be with Open Collective Foundation.
* You initiative **cannot **have multiple fiscal sponsors or [outside bank accounts](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/outside-accounts-policy). **All funds must be held in your Open Collective account **in order to accurately represent your budget/activities.

## **The Application**

Applying to be hosted by Open Collective Foundation takes only minutes!

You can prepare your application by previewing the questions:

{% content-ref url="application-questions.md" %}
[application-questions.md](application-questions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The application will have you choose whether you are starting a new collective or applying with an existing one. Then we'll provide you with some more information about being hosted by Open Collective Foundation and ask you to accept our [Terms of Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/getting-started/terms). Once you have reviewed our terms, proceed and review our [fee structure](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/fees) as well.

**When you are ready,** you can [go to our profile](https://opencollective.com/foundation) and click [**Apply**](https://www.opencollective.com/foundation/apply)**! **Fill out the [application questions](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/getting-started/how-to-apply/application-questions), accept the Open Collective platform [terms of service](https://opencollective.com/tos), and submit.

{% endhint %}

:question: If we have questions about your application, we may reach out to you to schedule a chat or request additional materials. 

:no_entry_sign: If your application is rejected, you will be informed as to why. You are welcome to reapply if adjustments are made to align with our requirements. We try to respond to applications within two business days.

:white_check_mark: If your initiative is accepted, congratulations! Once you have set up your initiative’s Open Collective page, you can begin accepting contributions (donations). We will reach out to notify you of your acceptance. We will provide you with a copy of your application for your reference (you may want to use the answers you submitted to [expand and customize ](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/customize-collective)your Open Collective profile) and instructions for [how to get started](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/basics)!

{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure to check your Spam folder for correspondence from OCF. Sometimes our emails end up in there.
{% endhint %}

## Transitioning to Open Collective

If you are transitioning from another fiscal host that uses the Open Collective platform, the [process is relatively simple](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/change-fiscal-host#what-is-the-process-for-changing-fiscal-hosts). If your initiative is currently with another organization that does not use Open Collective, the process will depend on that organization’s requirements, but in a nutshell they can transfer your money over and you can get up and running with OCF.

Please be sure to **communicate your plans** to both OCF _and _your old fiscal host in advance of your application to ensure a smooth transition. Once you have tied up any loose ends with your current host, they can transfer the funds to us electronically or send it to us by check. We can issue an invoice to them and sign agreements if needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
All funds for your initiative must be transferred to Open Collective Foundation, since initiatives may not hold funds for the project in [any other bank account](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/outside-accounts-policy) while hosted by OCF. Our normal [fees](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/fees) apply to funds transferred in.
