# Contributions FAQ

### **What if a contributor wants their contribution to be anonymous?**

Tell them about our incognito contribution feature! Or they can also make a [guest contribution](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/guest-contributions). You can also now [differentiate ](https://opencollective.com/opencollective/updates/new-legal-and-display-name-settings)your public display name from your private legal name.&#x20;

### **What if a financial contributor is unable or not comfortable with submitting their credit card information online?**

If a donor is not comfortable with online credit card transactions, they can send the funds via [Paypal](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions#credit-card-paypal-or-bank-transfer-contributions), [bank transfer](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions), or [check](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions#check-contributions).

### **What if a financial contributor requests a donation invoice?**

[Reach out to us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) - we are happy to procure an invoice of this kind when requested. Please provide: Donor name, Email, Initiative Name, & Donation amount (+ screenshots/links) for context.

### **Can we use outside fundraising platforms, like GoFundMe, to fundraise for our initiative?**

In most cases, yes! As long as the funds are transferred into your Open Collective account in a timely manner (30 days). Please note, that most of the time, donations not made on the Open Collective platform will not receive the tax- deduction. For more details, please review our [Outside Accounts Policy](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/outside-accounts-policy).&#x20;

Also, check out our [Third-Party Fundraising Tools page](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits) for more options and details about GoFundMe.

### **Can we receive earned income (i.e., non-donations) or sell stuff through OCF?**

OCF’s ability to support sales of goods and services as a means of fundraising [is limited](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations), but we will consider requests on a case-by-case basis.&#x20;

From our [Outside Entities Policy](../how-it-works/policies/outside-entities-policy.md#examples-of-generally-permitted-use-of-outside-entities):

> Initiatives may sell products or services through a distinct and separate outside entity where the proceeds are then donated to an Initiative under OCF (as long as buyers are made aware that their purchase is not a direct donation and isn’t tax deductible, and that the Initiative **and **the outside entity are separate and distinct).

### **Can we offer financial contributors something in return for their donation?**

If your initiative intends to sell or provide free goods or services in exchange for donations (a.k.a. partial deductibility), [you must](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations) [inform us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) and get our permission in advance.

### Can we run a raffle or other game of chance to raise money?

Due to state-by-state regulations and significant reporting requirements, OCF's initiatives cannot run raffles.

### **What should I do if I receive funds outside of the platform?**

As laid out in our [Terms](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vQ\_fs7IOojAHaMBKYtaJetlTXJZLnJ7flIWkwxUSQtTkWUMtwFYC2ssb-ooBnT-Ldl6wbVhNQiCkSms/pub) (Exhibit A, no. 6), when you receive funds outside of the platform, you must immediately [transfer them to your account with Open Collective Foundation](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/official-info). Please let us know when you do so, and we will then manually add the funds to your budget. You [cannot hold funds outside of your budget at any time](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations).

If you are using a third-party fundraising platform, please see the [Third-Party Tools and Benefits page](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits) for information on specific platforms.

### **Can my initiative donate to another hosted initiative?**

Initiatives [can easily give to other initiatives](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/collective-to-collective) hosted by Open Collective Foundation. (If you want to give to an initiative with another fiscal host there are [some extra steps](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/collective-to-collective#across-different-fiscal-hosts).)

### Can my group offer memberships/accept membership fees?

The platform has a '[Tier](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/collective-settings/tiers-goals#tiers)' type for membership fees. If all output/impact from an initiative is for 'members only', then it wouldn’t be for public benefit and therefore would not be [eligible ](../getting-started/eligibility.md)for fiscal hosting under OCF.

### **How do I cancel recurring donations/subscriptions/payments?**

See our instructions on how to cancel recurring or ongoing donations, subscriptions, payments, etc., [here](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments#cancel-a-recurring-contribution).

### Can I donate stock, cryptocurrency, real estate, a life insurance policy, or another major nontraditional gift?

[Get in touch with us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) and we will be happy to talk through possibilities.

### Where's my money?&#x20;

Ping us! We often receive money into our bank account without any indication of where it should go. (This is why it's so important to include the name of the initiative on any correpondances/checks/transfer that gets sent to OCF). We don't use/disperse that money anywhere, it just sits in our account until someone claims it, so just send us a message (in [slack ](http://slack.opencollective.com)or [email](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.foundation)) with screenshots/receipts that include the dollar amount & the initiative name, so that we may get your funds to you.
