# Leaving OCF

OCF seeks to support initiatives to have the greatest potential impact. If you've got a concern or issue, please bring it to us so we can try to help. We're always trying to learn and improve.

If staying with OCF can support you to achieve your initiative's best impact, then we want you to stay. If moving on is what's right for the mission, then that's what should happen.&#x20;

There are some practical and technical things to understand about the process of leaving OCF.

Details about leaving are spelled out in the 'termination' section of [our terms](https://opencollective.com/foundation/terms).

### Can we leave OCF?

Yes. We won't lock you in. You can close down your initiative, move to a different fiscal sponsor, or incorporate own entity. You can even [take your Collective with you when you go](leaving-ocf.md#undefined), in many cases. However there are some limitations to be aware of (see below).

### Is it a bad thing if an initiative leaves?

If we have failed to live up to expectations or alienated someone, that's bad. **** Or, if an initiative engages in misconduct or breaks policies to the point we can't let them stay, that's bad. Both of these 'failure' modes are exceedingly rare.

In the vast majority of cases, initiatives leave because they are evolving. They need something we can't provide, have founded their own nonprofit, or are winding down the whole project. We don't think these situations are necessarily bad. Projects naturally go through phases and we want to support them through.

### Can we take our money with us when we go?

OCF is limited by the regulations regarding 501(c)(3) nonprofits—this means we can usually only [transfer money to another 501(c)(3)](leaving-ocf.md#undefined).&#x20;

Once we give a tax deductible receipt for donated funds, we have to ensure they are only spent on allowed 501(c)(3) purposes. We can do that either by holding the funds for you as you spend them down, or by transfering them to another 501(c)(3) entity who is bound to follow the same rules.

### Sending funds to another 501(c)(3)

If you are moving from OCF to another 501(c)(3)—whether it's a new fiscal sponsor or your own new entity—submit an expense to move your balance over (or invite one if you don't run the other entity), and upload the determination letter as an attachment.

### **Moving to another Fiscal Host**

One thing that makes the Open Collective platform unique is that you can unplug a Collective from one Fiscal Host and plug it into another one, without losing your history, community, or recurring contributions.

If you have founded your own 501(c)(3), you can set it up as the Fiscal Host for your Collective going forward, and donations will flow to your bank account instead of OCF's. In that case, you no longer need to pay a Fiscal Hosting fee. Or, if you're joining another fiscal sponsor not yet on Open Collective, they can get set up on the platform and plug in their own bank account.

### Moving to a non-501(c)(3) entity

As mentioned above, we can only transfer your funds to another 501(c)(3) due to IRS regulations. If you're moving to a different kind of entity, you'll need to spend down the funds OCF holds on initiative expenses before leaving.

The only exception is if you've founded your own non-profit and applied for 501(c)(3) status, but are still awaiting your determinations letter. In this case we can sometimes put in place a legal agreement to enable transfering money.

### Archiving your Collective

If you want to shut your Collective down completely, you first need to zero the budget. You can do this by submitting expenses or donating the money to another OCF initiative. Once the balance is at zero, go to settings > advanced > archive.
