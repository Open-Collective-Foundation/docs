# Who We Are

Open Collective Foundation (OCF) is a fiscal sponsor and fiscal host ([what's that?](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/fiscal-hosting)) dedicated to providing a simple, open, lightweight path for charitable initiatives and communities to operate through a 501(c)(3) charitable entity ([what's that?](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/fiscal-hosting#what-does-501-c-3-mean)).

Hosted initiatives that align with our [impact areas](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/our-mission-and-values#our-missions-impact-areas) have access to the unique [Open Collective online platform](https://www.opencollective.com) for managing their funds. They can also receive **tax-deductible contributions** through our 501(c)(3) status.

[What is Open Collective](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/introduction)? It's is an open-source, online fundraising platform for open and transparent communities. **We provide the tools you need to raise and share your finances in full transparency.** 'Open Collective' founded 'Open Collective Foundation' as part of its mission to help collaborative groups collect and spend money transparently.
