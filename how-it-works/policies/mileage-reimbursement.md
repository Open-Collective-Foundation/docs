# Mileage Reimbursement Policy

This mileage reimbursement policy (“Policy”) allows volunteers of fiscally hosted collectives (“Collectives” and individually as “Collective”) under the umbrella of OpenCollective Foundation (“OCF”) and OCF employees **to be reimbursed for eligible travel expenses at rates set by the IRS.**

### What travel may be reimbursed?

Mileage expenses for which you seek reimbursement must have been incurred for charitable purposes, meaning you must have incurred this mileage while performing services as an employee or volunteer of OCF via the Collective.

An eligible “trip” may be a single path from A to B, or a set of multiple stops performed on a single day.&#x20;

#### Volunteer Travel

Volunteers incurring mileage while performing services as part of OCF via a hosted Collective may be reimbursed for qualified mileage, following the [process below](mileage-reimbursement.md#submitting-mileage-for-reimbursement).

#### Employee Travel

Individuals employed by OCF through Justworks may be reimbursed for qualified mileage incurred outside of normal travel to and from work, following the [process below](mileage-reimbursement.md#submitting-mileage-for-reimbursement). Employees’ daily commute is not eligible for reimbursement.&#x20;

#### Contractor Travel

Contractors providing services to OCF Collectives are not eligible for mileage reimbursement. They should consult with a tax advisor about proper processes for deducting mileage on their tax return.&#x20;

### Reimbursement Rates

Mileage reimbursement rates are set by the IRS on an annual basis. The rates for charities in 2022 are:

* **$0.14 per mile for unpaid OCF Collective volunteers**
* **$0.56 per mile for OCF employees**

If you do not receive payment via Justworks, you are not an employee of OCF.

### Submitting Mileage for Reimbursement

Within 60 days of the trip, volunteers and employees of OCF may submit mileage for reimbursement using the following process:

1. Complete the current year’s OCF Mileage Reimbursement Form (“Mileage Form”), found below.
2. Submit the Mileage Form as documentation (where a receipt would normally be uploaded) for a [Reimbursement Expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#reimbursements=) on the Collective’s profile.
3. Attach a screenshot of Google Maps, Apple Maps, or OpenStreetMap directions showing the trip and matching mileage to the Expense in an Expense Comment.
4. A Collective Admin will review the expense and approve if it meets their requirements.
5. OCF staff will review the expense and pay it if it meets the requirements of OCF policies.

The current Mileage Form can be found here:

A new Mileage Form must be submitted for each trip. Multiple Mileage Forms may be submitted in a single expense. Mileage Forms from previous years will not be accepted.

#### Active Car Insurance

Volunteers, employees, and contractors incurring mileage while performing services for OCF Collectives must have active car insurance.&#x20;

### Returning Excess Funds

In the event of any excess reimbursement provided, you must return such excess amount within 120 days after the expense was paid or incurred. An excess reimbursement is any amount you were paid that is more than the mileage expense that you adequately accounted for to OCF via your Collective’s page.&#x20;
