# Grants FAQ

{% hint style="success" %}
[More info about Applying for Grants here.](../how-it-works/financial-contributions/grant-funding.md)
{% endhint %}

### Where do I find OCF's official information for an external grant we are applying for?

{% content-ref url="../about/official-information-and-documents.md" %}
[official-information-and-documents.md](../about/official-information-and-documents.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Please be sure to have any correspondence sent to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.foundation) and be sure to include the name of the Collective.

For details about employee gift-matching programs, check [here](../how-it-works/financial-contributions/donation-matching.md).

### Where can we get an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding)?

You can send our [Terms of Fiscal Sponsorship](../terms/terms.md) document over when someone requests a fiscal sponsorship agreement (you agree to this when you tick the box when you sign up with us.)

If they require a signed document, please request one via email [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.foundation) (be sure to include the name of your Collective, and the name/details of the requester).

If you have a specific document that needs to be signed, please send it over to us so we can review it.

### **Can my Collective apply for government grants?**

Sometimes. If all that's needed is [proof of 501(c)(3) status](../about/official-information-and-documents.md#nonprofit-status), then yes. If special audits and more specific support is necessary, then unfortunately, no. We may be able to make exceptions, but it would be case-by-case. You can always [reach out](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.foundation) to check.

### **How do I receive my grant funds? Where/How do they send my grant money?**

[Here](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions) are all the ways people/organizations can make contributions to your Collective. If you will be receiving funds in a different method (e.g. [bill.com](http://bill.com/), YourCause), please be sure also email us with [these additional details](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/faq/grants-faq#expecting-incoming-grant-funds) (see below).

### Expecting incoming grant funds?

Send us an email contact@opencollective.foundation with the following:

* Date of funds transfer
* Name of funder
* Email address of funder
* Mailing address of funder
* Amount of grant
* Purpose of grant
* Disbursement method (e.g. check, bank transfer)
* Designation (which group) so we know where to allocate funds
