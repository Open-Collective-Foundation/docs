# Liability Insurance

[contact-us.md](../about/contact-us.md "mention")Through our insurance provider, [Nonprofits Insurance Alliance](https://insurancefornonprofits.org), Open Collective Foundation can offer our Collectives access to liability insurance and other types of coverage.

Per our [Terms of Fiscal Sponsorship](../getting-started/terms.md), only Collectives that sign up for insurance coverage are covered under OCF's policies.

**To sign up,** [**fill out this form**](https://forms.gle/PvoEijL4zhxr1gKZ8)**.**

Please note: this page does not include information about health insurance, only general liability and related coverage.
{% endhint %}

### Why get insurance through OCF?

* Because it's set up as an addendum to our main policies, Collectives can get covered in a simple and cost-effective way.
* As unincorporated groups, Collectives are usually unable to get insurance policies on their own.
* Getting liability insurance helps ensure that the individuals leading Collectives won't be held personally liable if something goes wrong.
* Sometimes funders, grants, landlords, venues, sponsors, etc, require insurance in the contracts they seek to sign with Collectives.

### What kinds of insurance are available?

* General Liability
* EPLI (for employment situations)
* Improper Sexual Conduct and Physical Abuse Liability
* Social Service Professional Liability
* Employee Benefits Liability
* Business Auto Liability
* Non-Owned/Hired Auto Liability
* Umbrella Liability
* Auto Physical Damage
* Businessowners Property
* Inland Marine
* Employee/Volunteer Dishonesty

{% hint style="info" %}
We cannot insure employees' or volunteers' personal vehicles. In cases where employees and volunteers use personal vehicles for Collective purposes, they are required to have car insurance.

### Is signing up for insurance required?

Usually getting insurance for your Collective is optional.

There are certain enhanced risk factors where OCF may require extra insurance, such as if the Collective:

* Has employees (not independent contractors).
* Wants to sign a lease for a physical premises.
* Specifically works with vulnerable people like children, disabled individuals, or the elderly.
* Offers formal counseling, education, tutoring, and other professional services.
* Wants to hold special (offline) events involving large numbers of people (e.g. a conference or fun run) or handle dangerous materials (e.g. hazardous waste cleanup, industrial tools).
* Driving vehicles to carry out Collective activities (beyond casual transport, such as moving trucks).

### How much does it cost?

The base General Liability cost is $250 per year, renewing August 18 of each year. Something to be aware of is that this cost is not prorated, so the cost will still be $250 mid-cycle. If the insurance underwriters determine that your Collective is riskier than usual, or if the scale of the Collective;'s work is quite large, the cost may be higher, so we cannot guarantee that the base cast will stay at $250 per year, although we have typically not seen this cost go above $600. (Collectives are also included in our Accident and Commercial Umbrella insurance coverages at no additional cost.)

Most Collectives are also added to our Non-Owned Auto coverage. This is typically another $25 per year (we've seen it be as high as $50 per year for larger Collectives), and it appears that this is sometimes prorated when added mid-year.&#x20;

If your Collective has employees, it will be added to our Directors & Officers policy, with an annual cost of up to $250 per year. Historically, this is only charged when we renew our policy every August, and not when Collectives sign-up mid-year, but we will keep an eye on this as that could change.

Special events and circumstances like hiking trips, fundraising events ($50-$200 each depending on risk), and additional Collective premises (see [Processes for insured Collectives](liability-insurance.md#undefined) below) may have their own associated costs. And Collectives may also have additional costs for other coverages, such as those listed [above](liability-insurance.md#what-kinds-of-insurance-are-available).

The last thing we should mention is that, nationally and across sectors, insurance costs are increasing at a high rate. We have found a good, nonprofit insurance company with steady premiums, but we cannot guarantee that these costs will stay the same year-to-year.

If these costs are acceptable - or if your activities fall within one of the [categories where insurance is required](liability-insurance.md#is-signing-up-for-insurance-required) - go ahead and [fill out the form](https://forms.gle/PvoEijL4zhxr1gKZ8) and we'll get your coverage in place as soon as possible.

For special situations outside the norm, or if you have any questions, [contact us](../about/contact-us.md) and we can talk things through.

### How do I sign up?

If you are interested in getting insurance for your Collective, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/PvoEijL4zhxr1gKZ8). We will then send you an addendum to our Terms for e-signature (this is the signal that we received your submission) and, once that is signed, we will send your information to the insurance company.

#### Timing

It can take several weeks (or even more, in some cases) to be added to our coverage, but the effective date should be the day a Collective admin signs the addendum.&#x20;

We will only reach out via email if we have questions about your submission, but feel free to [follow up with us](../about/contact-us.md) if you have questions or want a status update.

## Processes for insured Collectives

### Special events

Collective events (including fundraisers) are covered under our policy **unless** they involve, directly or indirectly, _**any**_ of the following:

* Any "fundraiser" ("any event sponsored or co-sponsored by the Collective with the primary purpose of raising monetary contributions") or “event” ("any activity sponsored or co-sponsored by the Collective apart from your regular scope of operations") with more than 500 people present at any one time
* Animals (including, but not limited to, animals involved in rodeos, petting zoos, animal exhibitions)
* Athletic activities or contests, not including golf or bowling
* Carnivals, circuses, fairs, festivals, parades
* Powered Rides or Amusement attractions (including, but not limited to, climbing walls, slides, mechanical bulls, bungee jumps)
* Firearms or weapons
* Water events (including, but not limited to, activities involving swimming pools, lakes, rivers or other bodies of water)&#x20;
* Trampolines, bounce houses, rebounding equipment, inflatable amusement or sports devices, moon walks, or inflatable wrestling or combatant suits.

Common examples of the above include:

* Outdoorsy activities (_all_ hikes, camping, climbing, etc., count as Athletic Events)
* 5K runs, bike rides, "dance/walk for" events, and other physical fundraisers
* Parades or marches organized or co-organized by a Collective

If an event you are involved in organizing meets any of these criteria, you must fill out this form and [send it to us](../about/contact-us.md) so that we can send it along to our insurers:

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/OCF Insured Special Event Form.pdf" %}

For Athletic Events, including outdoor activities, you also must collect waivers from all attendees.

### Adding or changing your physical premises

If you add a new permanent location, or start using a space on a regular basis for your operations, whether paid or for free, please [contact us](../about/contact-us.md) and send over any related contracts or agreements.&#x20;

If there is no contract with the leaseholder and/or landlord, and you are using the space free of charge, we will initiate a simple template agreement between parties so that our insurers have evidence of permission for you to use the space and we can ensure it is included in our General Liability insurance.&#x20;

Here is the template agreement:

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/Use of leased premises agreement.pdf" %}

### Annual renewal update

On an annual basis, we will send out a required survey to insured Collectives collecting information we need to complete our insurance renewal. This information includes:

* Updated volunteer numbers (and employee numbers, if they are changing in the near future)
* Premises updates, if any (although we prefer to learn of this in real time)
* Confirming that all volunteers and employees driving on behalf of the Collective have car insurance, where relevant
* Other changes in activities

OCF began offering insurance to Collectives in 2021, so the above processes will change over time! Thank you for your understanding, and please [let us know](../about/contact-us.md) if you have any questions.
