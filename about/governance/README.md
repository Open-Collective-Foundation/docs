# Governance

OCF aspires to interpret governance through the lens of our [mission & values](../mission-and-values.md), and our core principle of solidarity. Governance is a critical aspect of the compliance and oversight of OCF as a 501(c)(3) non-profit responsible for the funds of our Collectives and the public trust.&#x20;

Therefore, our approach to governance involves more traditional structures and functions, like overseeing annual audits and policy oversight, and more participatory processes, like the Collective-selected board seat the community will be voting on in late 2022.

Like everything about OCF, our governance approach continues to evolve as we grow and learn. And like everything at OCF, we welcome questions and feedback about governanceâ€”email us at contact@opencollective.foundation or post in the #ocf channel on [our Slack](https://slack.opencollective.com).
