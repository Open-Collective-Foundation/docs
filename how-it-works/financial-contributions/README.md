# Financial Contributions

{% hint style="info" %}
This page of documentation is written for financial contributors. If you are an initiative hosted by Open Collective Foundation, feel free to share this page with your donors. If they have questions that you cannot answer, [send them our way](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation)!
{% endhint %}

Open Collective Foundation allows donors to support amazing community charitable initiatives - legally - without them having to go through the laborious process of setting up a legal entity.

While Open Collective Foundation provides [plenty of benefits](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/what-we-offer) for our sponsored initiatives, there are also benefits for financial contributors. Since our hosted initiatives use [the Open Collective platform](https://opencollective.com/foundation#section-contributions), their finances are transparent, and you can feel confident that the funds will be put to good use.

Since we have 501\(c\)\(3\) status with the IRS, **financial contributions are tax-deductible to the extent of the law.** Once received we will issue a receipt that certifies that you have made this charitable contribution and you are not receiving any goods or services in return.

If you value what a project produces or stands for, support them to maintain and grow it! You can also be recognized by appearing on their page as a financial contributor.

You can contribute via the following methods:

* [Credit Card, Paypal, and Electronic Bank Transfer](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions#credit-card-paypal-or-bank-transfer-contributions)
* [Check](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions#check-contributions)
* [Donor-Advised Fund](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions#donor-advised-funds)
* [Matching Gift](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions#matching-gifts)
* [In-Kind](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions/in-kind) [\(i.e., “non-cash”\)](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions/in-kind)
* NEW! To donate public stock, please [reach out to us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation).

Further instructions on how to support one of our hosted initiatives via the above methods are included below. If you need any of our official information or documentation, see our [Official Information and Documents](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/official-information-and-documents).

{% hint style="info" %}
No matter which method you choose, make sure to whenever possible, **indicate the initiative** that you would like to support. If your chosen contribution method does not provide you with any opportunity to do so \(e.g., there is no memo line, accompanying letter, or online form\) [please reach out to us to let us know](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) the details of the transaction so we know to expect it and properly credit it when the funds arrive.
{% endhint %}

## Credit Card, PayPal, or Bank Transfer Contributions

To contribute to an initiative online on the Open Collective Platform via Credit Card, PayPal, or Bank Transfer \(a.k.a. ACH or wire transfer\), please see [this overview of the process](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments).

Once you choose to contribute from the initiative’s profile, our platform will guide you through the rest of the process, including choosing between credit card, PayPal, and electronic bank transfer \(i.e., ACH or wire\).

{% hint style="info" %}
The fastest way to have access to funds is through **Card/PayPal donations** made directly on the Open Collective Platform.

**Bank transfers \(e.g. ACH, wire\)** are done manually - this means it takes the funds a couple of days to clear \(due to bank processing times\), and then the allocation of the funds requires additional actions from OCF.  **It is important to allow for a few days \(minimum 3 business days\) when awaiting donations made via bank transfer.**
{% endhint %}

### **Bank Transfers**

If you select to make a contribution via bank transfer, we will provide instructions for making your contribution. The instructions will also be sent to you by email. Once the money has arrived in the initiative’s account, an administrator for the initiative will mark it as “paid” and the funds will show as part of the initiative’s balance.‌

When you arrange the transfer, if you have the option of sending an email notification for the transaction, please send it to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation). You can also reach out to that address if you run into any issues along the process - please note the reference number from your instruction email and contact us and we’ll be happy to help.

### **Giving Anonymously**

If you would like your contribution to be partially or fully anonymous, see our documentation on incognito and [guest](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/guest-contributions) contributions.

### **Secure Contributions**

Open Collective Foundation doesn't store donor credit card numbers on our servers. Instead, we partner with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe), a secure solution that is widely adopted by the industry, to process one-time and recurring contributions.

## Check Contributions

1. To contribute to an initiative via check, please follow the following procedure:
2. [ ] Make the check out to **Open Collective Foundation**.
3. [ ] Put the **name of the initiative** you would like to support in the **memo line**.
4. [ ] Mail the check to the following address:

> **Open Collective Foundation 501\(c\)\(3\)**
>
> **340 S. Lemon Avenue \#3717**
>
> **Walnut, CA 91789**

2. Then send an email to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) with the following information:

* Name & Email address of contributor \(whether an individual or organization\)
* Email address to send receipt
* Mailing address of contributor
* Name of Intended initiative
* Amount
* Contribution method \(e.g. Paypal, bank transfer\)
* Purpose of check \(e.g. Grant payment, Initial balance transfer, donation\)

We will process the check and designate the funds to the proper initiative once the check is received.

{% hint style="info" %}
Checks may take a few weeks to process and arrive into the initiative’s budget. We recommend [**contributing by credit card, PayPal, or electronic bank transfer**](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions#credit-card-paypal-or-bank-transfer-contributions) where possible \(especially for initial budget transfers\).
{% endhint %}

## Donor Advised Funds

Every donor advised fund \([what’s that?](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions/dafs)\) has a slightly different process!

* **If your fund can contribute via electronic bank transfer,** please ask them to [initiate a contribution](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments) via the initiative’s page. This is much faster than by check. Should you have the option of having them send an email notification for the transaction, please have it sent to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation).
* **If your fund needs to contribute via check**, please feel free to provide them with [our mailing address](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/official-information-and-documents#address). The check should be made out to Open Collective Foundation - NOT the name of the initiative you intend to support.

No matter which method they use, when you initiate the contribution, please make sure to **include the name of the initiative as the “designation” for this gift** or include it in another available comments or notes field.

Most donor-advised funds are familiar with fiscal sponsorship, but if they have any questions, please feel free to [direct them to us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) and we will be happy to fill them in.

## Matching Gifts

Matching gifts vary widely in their processes, but we are happy to work with your employer or other corporate sponsors to facilitate match funding. Sometimes matching gifts are slow to arrive, depending on the matcher’s processes, and your budget will not be credited until the funds actually arrive. Please refer [here ](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits#donation-matching)for more about what info we require.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sometimes OCF receives money without a description of which initiative to direct the funds to. **It is important for donors to specify the name of the initiative** in order to avoid delays. If you think your initiative has been sent funds, but that money has not been allocated to the budget, [reach out](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) to us to let us know \(+provide screenshots/receipts\).
{% endhint %}

## Other Ways To Give

* Interested in contributing **non-monetary** or **in-kind** items or property? [See our guide.](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions/in-kind)
* To make a donation on behalf of a company or funder, or some other group, we recommend [setting up an Organization](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/organizations) profile on the Open Collective platform.
* Initiatives hosted by Open Collective Foundation can also [make financial contributions to one another](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/collective-to-collective).
* Check our [Third Party Fundraising Tools & Benefits](../third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits/) page to see other ways that money can be sent to an initiative

If none of the above options work, you can make a direct contribution to Open Collective Foundation \(to one of our hosted initiatives\) through [external payment processors and bank transfers, without using the Open Collective platform](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/faq/non-platform). Be aware, however, that such contributions can take _much longer_ to arrive in the initiative’s budget.

Open Collective Foundation cannot currently receive donations via BitCoin. We are currently working on the ability to receive stock donations.

## Thank you!

On behalf of our initiatives, thank you for your support! We highly value all of our contributors. If there is anything you need, please [reach out](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation).
