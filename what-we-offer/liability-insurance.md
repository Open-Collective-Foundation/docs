### Why get insurance through OCF?

* Because it's set up as an addendum to our main policies, initiatives can get covered in a simple and cost-effective way.&#x20;
* As unincorporated groups, initiatives are usually unable to get insurance policies on their own.&#x20;
* Getting liability insurance helps ensure that the individuals leading initiatives won't be held personally liable if something goes wrong.
* Sometimes funders, grants, landlords, venues, sponsors, etc, require insurance in the contracts they seek to sign with initiatives.

### What kinds of insurance are available?

* General Liability
* EPLI (for employment situations)
* Improper Sexual Conduct and Physical Abuse Liability

### Is signing up for insurance required?

Usually getting insurance for your initiative is optional.&#x20;

There are certain enhanced risk factors where OCF may require extra insurance, such as if the initiative:&#x20;

* Has employees (not independent contractors).
* Wants to sign a lease for a physical premises.
* Specifically works with vulnerable people like children, disabled individuals, or the elderly.&#x20;
* Offers formal counseling, education, tutoring, and other professional services.&#x20;
* Wants to hold special (offline) events involving large numbers of people (e.g. a conference or fun run) or handle dangerous materials (e.g. hazardous waste cleanup, industrial tools).
* Driving vehicles to carry out initiative activities (beyond casual transport, such as moving trucks).

### How much does it cost?

For standard liability coverage, it's $600 per year (sometimes slightly less). If specialist coverage is required or the project is very large (like 1000+ volunteers involved), it may be more.

If $600 per year is acceptable, go ahead and [fill out the form](https://forms.gle/PvoEijL4zhxr1gKZ8) and we'll get your coverage in place as soon as possible.&#x20;

For special situations outside the norm, contact us about getting a quote, but please be aware that the quote process can be very slow (up to 2 months), so we recommend not waiting for a quote where possible.&#x20;
