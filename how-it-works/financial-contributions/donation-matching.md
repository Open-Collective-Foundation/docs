# Donation Matching

Matching gifts vary widely in their processes, but we are happy to work with your employer or other corporate sponsors to facilitate match funding. Sometimes matching gifts are slow to arrive, depending on the matcherâ€™s processes, and your budget will not be credited until the funds actually arrive. Please refer [here ](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits#donation-matching)for more about what info we require.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sometimes OCF receives money without a description of which initiative to direct the funds to. **It is important for donors to specify the name of the initiative **in order to avoid delays. If you think your initiative has been sent funds, but that money has not been allocated to the budget, [reach out](../../about/contact-us.md) to us to let us know (+provide screenshots/receipts).
{% endhint %}

OCF can process matching donations (including employee giving programs, matching gifts, contributions-matching, funds arriving from third-party giving platforms, and grant matches), but in order to do so, we need additional information about the donation.

**To ensure that a donation match goes through, please **[**email us**](../../about/contact-us.md)** the following:  **

* [ ] Donor name
* [ ] Donor company/employer name
* [ ] Initiative name
* [ ] Date(s) of original donation (if in two parts)
* [ ] Dollar amount of original donation
* [ ] The match amount or rate (i.e., 2x, 3x, 4x)
* [ ] If known, the platform used by the company/employer

Without the above information, we cannot guarantee that funds will be allocated properly and in a timely manner. This is due to the difficult manual processes required in order to correctly allocate those funds.&#x20;

If needed, you can find our **EIN number** on the [Official Information and Documents page](../../about/official-information-and-documents.md). Any email communications from your matching gift program should go to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation).&#x20;

If you are expecting funds and have not seen them arrive, or if you have donated funds via third-parties, please [email us at contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.com) with the above information included and we will be happy to locate and allocate those funds with you.
