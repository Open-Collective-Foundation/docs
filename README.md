# An update from Open Collective Foundation’s Board of Directors

It has been quite a challenging year. In February, we, the Board of Directors of Open Collective Foundation (OCF), announced that we had made the difficult decision to dissolve OCF by the end of this year. Today, we are announcing that OCF’s fiscal sponsorship program has officially ended, as of September 30, 2024.&#x20;

We are grateful to core OCF staffers Wayne Kleppe and Mike Strode for helping collectives navigate the staged winding down of our fiscal sponsorship program. Mike left the organization in June, and Wayne has stayed on as our sole employee to manage the many financial and administrative tasks related to our dissolution.&#x20;

This staged process allowed many collectives the time to create their own 501(c)(3) organizations or transfer to new fiscal sponsors. While we recognize that many collectives had to cease operations, we are heartened that many others are continuing their important work.

With the end of our fiscal sponsorship program, all prior collectives are now frozen on the Open Collective platform. We are now refocusing our efforts on the many legal and financial tasks related to the dissolution of OCF.&#x20;

We are around to answer any questions you may have. The best way to reach us is by emailing [generalinquiries@opencollective.org](mailto:generalinquiries@opencollective.org).&#x20;

We have been honored and proud to work with this community, and wish you all well.

Hafidha Acuay and Bart Westdijk

Board of Directors, Open Collective Foundation
