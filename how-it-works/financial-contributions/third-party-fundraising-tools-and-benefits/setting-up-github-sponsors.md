# Setting Up GitHub Sponsors

{% hint style="danger" %}
_**PLEASE NOTE**_**:** the below is only relevant to initiatives of Open Collective **Foundation**. Most open source projects on the platform are hosted by Open **Source** Collective.

If you are hosted by **Open Source Collective**, **** please see their documentation for how to set up GitHub Sponsors.
{% endhint %}

**This document is a guide to connecting** [**Github Sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors) **for Organizations to your initiative. This option is currently only available for initiatives fiscally hosted by the** **Open Collective Foundation, which will hold the funds on behalf of your project.**

_Note: Transaction data about the funds you receive through GitHub Sponsors will be shared with Open Collective Foundation in order to credit your budget._

This guide is **only** for initiatives using **Open Collective Foundation** as their fiscal host. Before signing up using this guide, confirm that your initiative has a fiscal host, and the fiscal host is **Open Collective Foundation**. You can see this on your initiative's home page:

‚Äã![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LWSZizTt4ZC1UNDV89f%2Fsync%2F278244fab32513c618371c3b6a3050d976e5b19e.png?generation=1606688579025573\&alt=media)‚Äã

If you have another fiscal host you will need to choose 'Fiscal Host: Other' when signing up for GitHub Sponsors and work with your fiscal host to get their bank account and tax information.

Open Collective Foundation initiatives can use Open Collective to receive GitHub Sponsors funds by following these steps:

1. Confirm that you have a **GitHub organization** (not an individual user account). You can create a GitHub organization by following [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).
2. ‚Äã[Create an initiative](https://opencollective.com/foundation/apply) for your charitable initiative if you don't already have one. You will need to use Open Collective Foundation as your fiscal host. _Note: Open Collective also has a thing called "Organizations" but this is unrelated. You need an Organization on the GitHub side and a Collective on the Open Collective side. Sorry for the confusing terms!_
3. Visit [github.com/sponsors](http://github.com/sponsors) and sign your Github organization up for the Sponsors waitlist. ‚úîÔ∏è Select: "This organization is using a fiscal host" and select Open Collective Foundation from the menu. ‚úîÔ∏è For non-profit status, answer: ‚ÄúYes, this organization has nonprofit status but and can receive tax-deductible donations from individuals (e.g., 501c3)‚Äù

## Setting up Stripe Connect <a href="#setting-up-stripe-connect" id="setting-up-stripe-connect"></a>

Once your application has been approved by GitHub, you need to connect Open Source Collective's Stripe account by following the below steps:

When you first click on the Stripe Connect account link, you will be taken to a Stripe sign up page.

### Country of operation and contact information <a href="#country-of-operation-and-contact-information" id="country-of-operation-and-contact-information"></a>

You will be asked to select the country where you legally operate from, or receive payouts in.

As Open Collective Foundation is a US entity, select **United States**.

Enter **your own phone number and email**, which will be used to verify the account and to send updates.

## Frequently Asked Question**s** <a href="#frequently-asked-question" id="frequently-asked-question"></a>

### What fees will be charged? <a href="#what-fees-will-be-charged" id="what-fees-will-be-charged"></a>

The standard Open Collective Foundation [fees ](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/fees)apply to funds raised via GitHub Sponsors: **5%**.&#x20;

GitHub does not charge a fee.

### Should I create an 'Organization' or an 'initiative'? <a href="#should-i-create-an-organization-or-a-collective" id="should-i-create-an-organization-or-a-collective"></a>

Confusingly, GitHub and Open Collective use the word "organization" to mean two different things.

* **On GitHub, you need to create an Organization** to use Sponsors for your project.
* **On Open Collective, you need to create an initiative** for your project (Organizations on Open Collective's site are a different profile type, for companies who are fiscal hosts, or sponsor open source projects, i.e. for paying money out not accepting money).
