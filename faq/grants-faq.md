# Grants FAQ

### Where do I find OCF's official information for an external grant we are applying for?

{% content-ref url="../about/official-information-and-documents.md" %}
[official-information-and-documents.md](../about/official-information-and-documents.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Please be sure to have any correspondance sent to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.foundation) and be sure to include the name of the initiative.

For details about employee gift-matching programs, check [here](../how-it-works/financial-contributions/donation-matching.md).

### Where can we get an MOU (Memorandum of understanding)?

You can send our [Terms of Fiscal Sponsorship](../getting-started/terms.md) document over when someone requests a fiscal sponsorship agreement (you agree to this when you tick the box when you sign up with us.)

If they require a signed document, please request one via email [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.foundation) (be sure to include the name of your initiative, and the name/details of the requester).

If you have a specific document that needs to be signed, please send it over to us so we can review it.

### **Can my initiative apply for government grants?**

Sometimes. If all that's needed is [proof of 501(c)(3) status](../about/official-information-and-documents.md#nonprofit-status), then yes. If special audits and more specific support is necessary, then unfortunately, no.  We may be able to make exceptions, but it would be case-by-case. You can always [reach out](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.foundation) to check.
