# These Docs

**This documentation primarily relates to** [**Open Collective Foundation**](https://opencollective.foundation/). If you are looking for general documentation about the Open Collective software platform, also used by many other fiscal hosts, [see the Open Collective documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/).

We also recommend that you take a look at Open Collective‚Äôs [Community Guidelines](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/community-guidelines), [Values](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/values), and [Privacy Policy](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/privacy-policy).

### Terminology

Since the **Open Collective** **platform** works with hosts and initiatives all over the world, **Open Collective Foundation** \(as a US-based fiscal host\), has developed some specific terms to describe interactions and roles, [laid out in Open Collective‚Äôs documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/terminology). As a result, you will notice that we tend to use the terms [‚Äúfiscal host‚Äù rather than ‚Äúfiscal sponsor‚Äù](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/fiscal-hosting) and ‚Äú[financial contribution](../how-it-works/financial-contributions/)‚Äù rather than ‚Äúdonation.‚Äù

In contrast to the Open Collective platform documentation, OCF uses the term ‚Äúinitiative‚Äù to describe our hosted groups rather than ‚Äúcollective,‚Äù since we host [both Collectives and Funds](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/what-we-offer#two-kinds-of-initiatives).

{% hint style="info" %}
Organizational financial contributors are also sometimes known in the fundraising world as **‚Äúsponsors‚Äù or ‚Äúcorporate sponsors.‚Äù** They may want brand exposure, access to or goodwill from a community, or other benefits. Make sure you are clear when using the term ‚Äúsponsorship‚Äù however, since the service we provide is known as [fiscal ‚Äúsponsorship](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/fiscal-hosting)[.‚Äù](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/fiscal-hosting)
