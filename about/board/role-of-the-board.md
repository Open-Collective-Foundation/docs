# Role of the Board

### **The board of directors is responsible for governance.**

Directors fulfill a necessary legal role, and also an important organizational support function. From [The National Council of Nonprofits](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/board-roles-and-responsibilities):

> The board of directors of a nonprofit has three primary legal duties known as the “duty of care,” “duty of loyalty,” and “duty of obedience.”\
> \
> Duty of Care: Take care of the nonprofit by ensuring prudent use of all assets, including facility, people, and good will;\
> \
> Duty of Loyalty: Ensure that the nonprofit's activities and transactions are, first and foremost, advancing its mission; Recognize and disclose conflicts of interest; Make decisions that are in the best interest of the nonprofit corporation; _not in the best interest of the individual board member_ (or any other individual or for-profit entity).\
> \
> Duty of Obedience: Ensure that the nonprofit obeys applicable laws and regulations; follows its own bylaws; and that the nonprofit adheres to its stated corporate purposes/mission.\
> \
> However, a board of directors does not exist solely to fulfill legal duties and serve as a fiduciary of the organization’s assets. Board members also play very significant roles providing guidance to nonprofits by contributing to the organization’s culture, strategic focus, effectiveness, and financial sustainability, as well as serving as ambassadors and advocates. Beyond fulfilling legal duties, board members can be important resources for the organization.

This is distinct from the role of the operational team, OCF's staff, and executive management, which implements the day to day functioning of the organization.
