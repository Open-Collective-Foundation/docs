# Off-Platform Contributions

{% hint style="danger" %}
**PLEASE MAKE YOUR CONTRIBUTION** [**THROUGH THE OPEN COLLECTIVE PLATFORM**](./) **WHEREVER POSSIBLE. Using the platform is the best way to ensure the quickest, smoothest experience.**
{% endhint %}

If you would like to contribute but would prefer to do so **without** using the Open Collective platform, you will have to manually arrange the payments yourself. Also, **you will need to communicate with us** about your payment so that we can properly allocate it to the intended hosted Collective.

When you make your contribution, please send all of the following information to us [via email](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation):

* Name of contributor (whether an individual or organization)
* Email address to send receipt
* Mailing address of contributor
* Intended Collective **(This is very important, as OCF needs to know where to allocate the donated funds)**
* Amount
* Contribution method

Additionally, please include the Collective’s name in the transaction wherever possible,—comments, descriptions, and wherever else is available to you. This will help us to designate the funds to the correct Collective as quickly as we can. If you intend to support multiple Collectives with a single transaction, please [let us know](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) as soon as possible.

**To contribute externally via electronic bank transfer** (also known as ACH or wire transfer), send funds to the account information listed on the [Official Information and Documents page](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/official-info).

{% hint style="info" %}
Should you have the option of sending an email notification for the transaction, please send it to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation). Please remember to include the **name of the Collective** so that it can be properly designated. Then **send us an email** with your information, following the directions above.
{% endhint %}

**To contribute externally via some other method** please reach out to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) and we will assist you on a case-by-case basis.

Please review our [**Outside Accounts Policy**](../policies/outside-accounts-policy.md) **** for additional information.
