# How we're different

### **OCF vs. Other Fiscal Sponsors**

One thing that makes Open Collective Foundation different from [other fiscal sponsors](https://fiscalsponsordirectory.org) is the Open Collective platform, a powerful, [open-source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) tool for managing your activities and funds transparently providing you with **24/7 access** to collect, spend, and manage funds. You can quickly and easily:

* Begin charitable/community work **without setting up a legal entity or bank account**
* Create a [public profile](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/customize-collective) with your own URL
* Receive tax-deductible [financial contributions](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions), with tax receipts generated automatically
* Share financial activity and [goals](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/tiers-goals#goals) transparently with your team, supporters, and wider community
* [Pay expenses, reimbursements, and compensate team members for their work](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses), with invoices generated automatically
* [Update ](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/communication)and communicate with your financial contributors & admins
* Set up [events ](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/events)and sell tickets that go straight into your initiative's budget
* Join the growing Open Collective network - [Read our Community Guidelines](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/community-guidelines)

Traditional fiscal sponsors’ processes are often slow, manual, and opaque, whereas Open Collective is efficient, automatic, and transparent.

### **Open Collective vs. Accounting Software**

Our platform has great features that you won’t find in most accounting software, like integrated payments for expenses via PayPal or bank transfer. Your hosted initiative will be able to process large numbers of transactions, big or small, without the accounting headaches. **You’ll no longer have to step into the complexity of a full fledged accounting tool in order to do basic budget tracking and good money management**.

### **Open Collective vs. Crowdfunding Campaigns**

It also differs from crowdfunding platforms, particularly in how it is designed to be a home for **ongoing collaborative communities**, not individual creators or one-off campaigns. Unlike crowdfunding platforms, our service allows you to:

* Access funds as they arrive, rather than in a lump sum at the end of the campaign
* Spend funds for your initiative directly from the platform, rather than having the funds go through your personal bank account
* Receive **recurring** monthly contributions
* Accept **tax-deductible** contributions (this is a big incentive for donors)
* View your initiative’s budget **in full transparency**
* [Export complete contribution and expense data](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/budget) in CSV documents
* [R](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions)[eceive donations](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions), [post Updates](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/communication), and gain momentum—as you would while crowdfunding—without limiting your long-term reach

Unlike campaign-based crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe or Patreon, Open Collective can be a long-term home for your operations. We’re always working on new features to help you build community and accomplish your mission.
