# These Docs

**This documentation primarily relates to** [**Open Collective Foundation**](https://opencollective.foundation).

We also recommend that you take a look at Open Collective’s [Community Guidelines](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/community-guidelines), [Values](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/values), and [Privacy Policy](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/product/privacy-policy).

### Terminology

Since the **Open Collective** **platform** works with hosts and initiatives all over the world, **Open Collective Foundation** (as a US-based fiscal host), has developed some specific terms to describe interactions and roles, [laid out in Open Collective’s documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/terminology). As a result, you will notice that we tend to use the terms [“fiscal host” rather than “fiscal sponsor”](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/fiscal-hosting) and “[financial contribution](../how-it-works/financial-contributions/)” rather than “donation.”

{% hint style="info" %}
Organizational financial contributors are also sometimes known in the fundraising world as **“sponsors” or “corporate sponsors.”** They may want brand exposure, access to or goodwill from a community, or other benefits. Make sure you are clear when using the term “sponsorship” however, since the service we provide is known as [fiscal “sponsorship](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/fiscal-hosting)[.”](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/fiscal-hosting)
