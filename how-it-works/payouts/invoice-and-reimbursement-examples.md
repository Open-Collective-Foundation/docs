# Invoice and Reimbursement Examples

## Invoices  <a href="#invoices" id="invoices"></a>

​[Invoices](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#invoices) should be used to pay individuals for work completed on behalf of the collective. Unlike reimbursements, a photo or a PDF of an invoice document is not required for invoices to be submitted on the Open Collective [platform](../../what-we-offer/online-platform.md). However, there are some requirements for how an invoice is opened on the platform itself.

### Invoices must meet the following criteria to be paid: <a href="#invoices-must-meet-the-following-criteria-to-be-paid" id="invoices-must-meet-the-following-criteria-to-be-paid"></a>

* Must have a description of the work done, and the amount of time (normally in hours) spent on work or time covered (normally in months).
* The payee must include their billing address.
* The payee's name must match the billing contact.
* For any invoice over $5000USD:
  * the payee can’t be the one who approved the expense (unless they are the sole admin) and;
  * the payee must be a verified user or provide a form of banking integration.

**Regarding descriptions:** Invoices need a clear description of services rendered and provide sufficient detail to make it clear what the collective is paying for. This is because this description may be checked by our accountant for compliance. That means that someone with no knowledge of your project should be able to understand what was done from the description. &#x20;

To make this easier, we suggest:

* Using words like "maintenance" or "development", instead of more generic words like "payment" or "work".
* Adding a link to any external documentation that may help make this clear, such as a blog post, or similar.

We may mark an invoice **incomplete** and follow up on invoices which lack sufficient explanation of the work performed. This does not mean we are cancelling your payment, but that we need you to add more detail to the description.

## Reimbursements <a href="#reimbursements" id="reimbursements"></a>

Use[ reimbursements](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#reimbursements) to pay for purchases, donations, or subscriptions made on behalf of the collective.

Receipts are required so that we can ensure the requested amount matches the purchased amount in order to approve the reimbursement.

A **valid receipt** contains:

1. Name of the vendor (person or company you paid)
2. Transaction date (when you paid)
3. A detailed description of goods or services purchased (what you bought)
4. Amount paid
5. The currency in question. This is normally clear from the address and the currency symbol.
6. Form of payment (cash, check, or last four digits of the credit card)
