### **Nonprofit Rates & Discounts** <a href="#nonprofit-rates" id="nonprofit-rates"></a>

Through OCF’s 501(c)(3) status, our Collectives are eligible for a variety of nonprofit rates and benefits. Don’t forget to inquire to vendors and venues about a possible discount! Please note that sales tax exemption rules differ across all 50 states and sometimes municipalities. Therefore, this is not an area where OCF can support projects in accessing and we recommend you seek the support of a local fiscal sponsor where this support is required.

### **Google Workspace**

We can set up free Google Workspace accounts for you if you have a domain name. [Learn more](emails.md).

### **Techsoup**

Techsoup has expressed that [discounts through TechSoup do NOT extend to fiscally hosted projects](https://www.techsoup.org/support/product-donation-faq#collapse3-4). This is unfortunate, as many such discounts rely on a Techsoup ID to activate, but there's not much we can do about it.

### **Slack**

Slack offers discounts through TechSoup, and Techsoup is not compatible with fiscal hosting.

### Loomio

Loomio is able to offer a discounted rate to groups hosted by Open Collective Foundation of $6/month (normally $25) per month. To access this discount, groups should complete the following steps.

1. Create a group on Loomio using the steps outlined [here](https://help.loomio.com/en/user\_manual/groups/starting\_a\_group/index.html).
2. Complete a [signup form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetp4H9FiSFhgw-z\_2qo1ON9YSh-9lINn3IBYC0kj9nNl5log/viewform) to tell OCF details about your Loomio instance
3. OCF will connect your Loomio instance to our subscription which should eliminate any trial notifications.
