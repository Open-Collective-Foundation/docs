# Setting Up GitHub Sponsors

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**PLEASE NOTE**_**:** this documentation is only relevant to Collectives of Open Collective _Foundation_. Most open source projects on the platform are hosted by Open _Source_ Collective.

If you are hosted by **Open Source Collective**, **** [please see their documentation](https://docs.oscollective.org/getting-started/github-sponsors) for how to set up GitHub Sponsors.
{% endhint %}

If you are a charitable project hosted by Open Collective Foundation - not Open Source Collective - and you would like to set up GitHub Sponsors, please [reach out to us](../../../about/contact-us.md) and we'll help you get set up.
