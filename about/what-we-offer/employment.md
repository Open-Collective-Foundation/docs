# Employment

## About

Initiatives fiscally hosted by OCF can have employees, with access to benefits like health insurance. Costs related to employment are paid from the initiative's budget, with OCF as the employer.

### How it works

The initiative admins define who to hire (themselves or others), how much to pay in salaries, and the job descriptions. Initiatives decide their own internal management structure, work practices, hours, and other day to day aspects of the job.&#x20;

OCF ensures legal compliance with employment regulations, and takes care of payroll, liability, taxes, workers comp, and all the paperwork.&#x20;

### Healthcare & Benefits

Benefits ar

Because many initiatives operate under the OCF umbrella, we can access large group health insurance plans only available to employers. This lowers costs an increases available options.

Employees can decide whether or not to sign up for healthcare or other benefits, and the initiative's budget is only charged for benefits if they opt-in. There are a wide range of plans, which vary depending on the employee's place of residence and other factors. Once an employee gets set up and wants to activate health insurance, they can choose from available options.

### Costs

The following costs are charged to the initiative budget for employment:

* **Wages** (and associated taxes, levies, and fees as required by law) - salary amounts are set by the initiative
* **Benefits** - if the employee chooses to opt in
* **PEO fees** - payroll provider costs ($49 or $99 per month per employee depending on benefits status)
* **Insurance** - coverage for the initiative under OCF's employer practices liability insurance and related policies (varies depending on initiative activities, but commonly $250 per year)
* **Administrative fee** - $50 per employee per month

Costs are automatically deducted monthly from the initiative's budget. Once employment is set up, employees will be paid by direct debit and initiatives do not have to take any action to manage ongoing expenses.

### Requirements & Policies

* Employees must be located in the US and be allowed to legally work in the US.
* OCF can currently only support salaried, exempt, part-time or full-time employees, not hourly or manual workers. Other people, who ar
* All employees have unlimited PTO and we do not track or pay out PTO.
* Initiatives must maintain a budget of at least 3x monthly employment costs, to ensure funds are available to pay employees. (For fixed-term employment situations, it may be possible to drop below this threshold toward the end of the contract.)
* Employees and initiative admins have to agree to the terms of the standard OCF employment agreement ([template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T-KYVOAGx74uJXGElVSuAKWOLgmsISJHVCHnwF4s-Xc/edit?usp=sharing)).
* Employees must agree to follow the policies in the OCF Employee Handbook, which covers things like non-harassment, various kind of statutory leave, health and safety, etc. Each state has slightly different required policies so the handbook varies by state (here is the [New York handbook as an example](https://handbookbuilder.blr.com/ViewHandbook.aspx?id=144Zswg66i9nFJXzqH4kAG6tgu0ZfNN5rExPEKCQ6jge)).

### Worker Classification

Anyone who wishes to be employed and meets the above requirements is welcome to be employed by OCF. Conversely, there are situations where the law says we must make someone an employee instead of a contractor. Defining whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor is called worker classification.&#x20;

There are laws designed to prevent worker exploitation and ensure workers are afforded the protections and benefits of employment where appropriate. Regulations vary by stateâ€”someone in California may need to be employed while someone in Texas doing the same work might be allowed to be a contractor.

If you'd like to learn more about classification, read the guide below. It's a complex topic and we regularly run scenarios past our lawyer to be sure. If you have any questions about classification, please [contact us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation).

## Set up Employment

Here are the steps to employ someone.

1. If they have not already done so previously, initiative admin follows the process to [set up liability insurance](liability-insurance.md) (it can take some time for the insurer to process, so please do this first).
2. Initiative admin fills out the [Employment Setup Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUQThuDQIOODd\_Vi1mU9yC-FYu6USAPIJEfSFEOjMhVnKCSw/viewform) (fill it out once per employee if multiple).
3. OCF sets up the employment contract and requests signatures from the initiative admin and the employee.
4. OCF invites the employee to Justworks, our PEO/payroll system.
5. The employee starts getting paid by direct debit every 2 weeks.
6. OCF will debit employment-related costs from the initiative's budget monthly.

## Terminating Employment

OCF is an at-will employer, and either OCF or the employee may end the employment relationship at any time. In most circumstances, OCF will terminate employment at the instruction of the intiative admin named as the employee's supervisor in the employment contract.&#x20;

Fixed term employment contracts will expire upon the end date specified unless they are extended. If the initiative or employee no longer meets the basic [requirements for employment](employment.md#requirements-and-policies), the employment relationship will end.

Where possible, we ask initiatives to give OCF advance notice so we can take care of the termination process in a timely manner.&#x20;
