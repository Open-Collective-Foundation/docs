### **What does the approval process look like for expenses?**

Please see [Submitting Expenses](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses) for more information on the approval process.

### **Can we send or receive funds via Venmo or Cash App?**

Unfortunately, these services do not currently allow nonprofit accounts.&#x20;

If you work with a mutual aid or solidarity project and must use these apps, please see our [Cash Assistance Policy](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/cash-assistance-policy).&#x20;

### **Can we pay people for their time?**

Yes!&#x20;

Some groups who started out all-volunteer have hesitations when it comes to starting to pay people—especially if their mission is about countering negative impacts of economic exploitation in our capitalist society, which is understandable. It's true that beginning to pay people can change the dynamics, and bring up complicated questions about who gets paid and how much.

However, we encourage initiatives to take these questions and concerns on and have frank conversations as a group about them, because that's a really healthy step to take. Regardless of the conclusion, important thinking and communication will happen. It is possible to pay people in ethical, transparent, accountable, mindful ways.

OCF's mission is about the sustainability of positive impact initiatives. We help groups raise money so they can be resourced to grow and thrive. Often, that is about paying for people's time. While initiatives need to be mindful with their financial resources, human capacity is a resource too, and burning people out is not the way.

OCF won't tell you what to do—it's up to initiatives to make these decisions. But we encourage you to think about the long-term health of your initiative and the well-being and development of the humans who make it all possible.

You can pay people casually as contractors through invoice expenses on your Collective, or if they'll be working on a regular basis, employ them part or full time.

### **Do you offer payroll and employment services?**

Yes! With health insurance and benefits, too. [More info](../what-we-offer/employment.md).

### What about tax forms?

Open Collective Foundation must collect[ tax forms](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/tax-information#info-for-expense-submitters-getting-paid) for any individual who **invoices** (this does not apply to **reimbursements** or **payroll)** over $600 in year. Those individuals will be automatically issued a 1099. [Here](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Self-Employment-Taxes/Filing-IRS-Form-W-9/INF19741.html)'s a good explanation of how W-9s work for independent contractors, and there's more info on what a 1099 is [here](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Self-Employment-Taxes/What-is-an-IRS-1099-Form-/INF14810.html).

When you submit an expense that puts you over the $600 threshold, you will be sent an email with a link to complete your tax form online. This email will come from HelloWorks, the system we use to handle the forms.

Expenses will not be paid out to you until you submit the tax form.

If you don’t meet the $600 threshold, simply report your earnings as miscellaneous self-employment income when you file your taxes as described above.&#x20;

Please note: If you are paid via Paypal, OCF will not issue you a 1099 because Paypal is responsible for that. So you will not be asked for a tax form if paid via Paypal. However, Paypal only sends out 1099s when >$20,000 is invoiced. This means you will not get a 1099 from Paypal or OCF if you receive less than $20,000 total from Paypal.

### **Can I be incognito/not display my name?**

We [now](https://opencollective.com/opencollective/updates/new-legal-and-display-name-settings) have the option to differentiate between your _public_ display name, and your _private_ legal name.

We do need your real name as your legal name, because we are bound by IRS regulations and need to be able to ensure funds are being used appropriately. This private legal name will only be visible to admins.

Details such as attachments, comments, the private note section, and the payout method information are **only** visible to the submitter of the request, the collective admin, and the fiscal host admin who processes the actual payment. Confidential details can also be included in those areas to ensure privacy.

### How can we pay for large expenses that we cannot 'pay out-of-pocket and then get reimbursed later'?

As a 501(c)(3) we cannot give out lump sums first and get receipts later.  This is because, with the IRS regulations for a charitable nonprofit, we have to be able to track all funds that come in and go out of our accounts.&#x20;

Check our [payouts.md](../how-it-works/payouts.md "mention") page for information about all the different ways payouts can be made through OCF.  &#x20;

For large expenses that you cannot pay out-of-pocket, you can also have your vendors and service providers submit their invoices directly via your initiative's page, or you can use the "[invite expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#inviting-a-third-party-to-submit-an-expense)" option, where you fill in the details and they recieve an email and then just need to confirm. So vendors can invoice OCF through your page to get paid, and then we pay them directly.
