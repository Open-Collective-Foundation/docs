# Other Ways To Give

* Interested in contributing **non-monetary** or **in-kind** items or property? [See our guide.](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions/in-kind)
* To make a donation on behalf of a company or funder, or some other group, we recommend [setting up an Organization](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/organizations) profile on the Open Collective platform.
* Collectives hosted by Open Collective Foundation can also [make financial contributions to one another](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/collective-to-collective).
* Check our [Third Party Fundraising Tools & Benefits](third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits/) page to see other ways that money can be sent to an Collective

If none of the above options work, you can make a direct contribution to Open Collective Foundation (to one of our hosted Collectives) through [external payment processors and bank transfers, without using the Open Collective platform](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/faq/non-platform). Be aware, however, that such contributions can take _much longer_ to arrive in the Collectiveâ€™s budget.

Open Collective Foundation cannot currently receive donations via BitCoin. We are currently working on the ability to receive stock donations.
