_Virtual Card Issuing Policy: Updated November 13th, 2023_

### Requirements_:_

* Cards are **only issued to collectives who have employment** and can **only be assigned to employees**. No exceptions will be made;
* All spending must comply with **normal usage for a 501(c)(3) and IRS charitable compliance**;
* No physical card will be issued, and as such, these cards **may not be used for in-store purchases**;
* Cards **may not be linked** to PayPal or other 3rd party applications;
* **Cards may not be used for paying individuals or contractors** (LLC’s or otherwise);
* **Receipts are required to be submitted within 30 days**;
* **Cards may not be used for purchasing gift cards**;
* Cards **may not be used to pay rent**;

Any violations of these requirements will lead to immediate deletion of the Collective's card. Only one card will be issued per collective. **Cards will only be issued with a monthly spending limit not to exceed $5,000**.&#x20;



**Please submit your request in the following format**, including estimated monthly expenses and vendor information (when applicable), along with the total dollar amount at the bottom.\
For example:\
\- Zoom subscription, $50/month\
\- Target Cleaning Supplies, $100/month\
\- Amazon AWS, $250/month\
\- Walmart Groceries, $100/month\
Total: $500

### How it Works:

_Funds are only spent as transactions occur._

1. Initiative admins request the card from OCF (Requests should be formatted as described above)
2. OCF will assign the card
3. Once assigned, the card assignee will be notified via email. The card's details will appear in the initiative's Settings for admins to use, in accordance with this policy.

**After a purchase is made:**

1. The funds will be withdrawn from your collective’s balance;
2. An "Invitation to submit an expense" will be sent to your collective’s admins;
3. Admins will be asked to submit your receipt via email. (If the receipt is not submitted within 30 days, the card access will be paused until you do submit the receipt).
