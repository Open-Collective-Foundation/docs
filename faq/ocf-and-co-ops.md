# OCF & Co-ops

Open Collective Foundation's values very much align with the [5 Principles of a Solidarity Economy](https://cooperationhumboldt.com/about-1/) and the [7 Cooperative Principles](https://ncbaclusa.coop/resources/7-cooperative-principles/). The OCF team has a lot of experience with and love for cooperative structures, and as an organization we absolutely aspire to support co-ops.

Since [explicitly naming our solidarity economy focus](https://blog.opencollective.com/solidarity-as-our-guiding-principle/), naturally more cooperatives have been getting in touch. This page sets out some key points about how we can and can't serve co-ops.

## Is OCF a good fit for co-ops? Yes and no.

OCF is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that [fiscally hosts](../what-we-offer/fiscal-hosting.md) initiatives with missions around education, social impact, and civic engagement. We're set up to serve a wide range of groups and activities, but not for everything.

### When it's about education.... yes

Are your activities focused on education about co-ops, capacity-building, research, mentorship, and building supportive communities learning about co-ops? Then we'd love to host you!&#x20;

This also includes groups who are in the early stages of organizing around a social impact mission with potentially cooperative aspirations, but haven't yet settled on the structure they want to have (with some caveats... see below).

### When it's about collaborative practice... possibly

If your interest in cooperation is about running a social impact initiative collaboratively, and practicing things like managing a budget together, how to make decisions as a group, sharing information, etc, then joining OCF can be a great way to start doing that stuff for real without having to take on heavy burdens involving legal entities and compliance.

However, your cooperative practice has to be around a mission that fits [our criteria](../getting-started/eligibility.md), i.e. focused on education, social impact, or civic engagement. If it's cooperation in service of other aims, like building a business, it might not work (see below).

### When it's about business... probably no

A lot of cooperatives are businesses, and that's great! So much fantastic stuff can happen for people and communities through cooperative commerce. However, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, that's not what OCF is designed for. Initiatives under our umbrella can do revenue-generating activities, but it all has to be in service to mission focused on education, social impact, or civic engagement.

### When it's about ownership... no

The power of the cooperative model is about literal co-ownership in many cases. As a nonprofit, that's not a model that can fit inside OCF. You can practice many aspects of cooperative-style governance within an OCF-hosted initiative, but member or worker _ownership_ is not possible in our structure.

### When it's about incubation... sometimes

Early stage projects sometimes don't know what structure is right for them, and enabling that decision to happen when the time is right can be a real benefit. Sometimes proto-cooperatives get bogged down trying to answer a bunch of structural questions too early (like who should be the directors, processes for shareholding, etc).

If your focus is on one of our [mission areas](../about/mission-and-values.md) and you're seeking a way to get started quickly and easily so you can figure out structure questions later, OCF can sometimes be a good option. But it's important to understand the limitations.

Once money enters a 501(c)(3), it has to either be used to further the purpose it was donated for (i.e. used for project expenses), or transferred to another 501(c)(3). We can't transfer money out to a non-501(c)(3) in most cases. We don't want people to join OCF, raise a bunch of money, decide they want to found a commercially-focused cooperative, and not be able to bring their money over. So it's important to be aware of this restriction. Most cooperative structures are not 501(c)(3)s.

## Resources & Options

Here are some links and resources to find other kinds of support for co-ops that OCF might not be able to provide.

## Co-op Dreams

We would love to see more co-ops on the Open Collective platform!&#x20;

It's good to remember that OCF is only one host among many. There are Fiscal Hosts like OCF specifically designed to serve co-ops in several countries:

* [Platform6](https://opencollective.com/platform6-coop) - UK
* [Hypha](https://opencollective.com/hyphacoopinc) - Canada
* [Incubator.coop](https://opencollective.com/incubator-coop) - Australia

We would love to see a co-op Fiscal Host emerge in the US! The right mix of people, resources, and timing just hasn't quite clicked to make it happen yet. How cool would it be to have a Fiscal Host specifically structured to support co-op Collectives? If you are interested in that idea, [get in touch](mailto:support@opencollective.com).

Also, the platform can be used by any entity to [create a Fiscal Host](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/become-a-fiscal-host) or be an [Independent Collective](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/independent-collectives). So if you plan to or have already incorporated a co-op entity, you can absolutely plug Open Collective into it.
