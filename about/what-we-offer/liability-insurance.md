### Why get insurance through OCF?

* Because it's set up as an addendum to our main policies, initiatives can get covered in a simple and cost-effective way. 
* As unincorporated groups, initiatives are usually unable to get insurance policies on their own. 
* Getting liability insurance helps ensure that the individuals leading initiatives won't be held personally liable if something goes wrong.
* Sometimes funders, grants, landlords, venues, sponsors, etc, require insurance in the contracts they seek to sign with initiatives.

### What kinds of insurance are available?

* General Liability
* EPLI \(for employment situations\)
* Improper Sexual Conduct and Physical Abuse Liability
* Social Service Professional Liability

### Is signing up for insurance required?

Usually getting insurance for your initiative is optional. 

There are certain enhanced risk factors where OCF may require extra insurance, such as if the initiative: 

* Employs workers \(not independent contractors\).
* Wants to sign a lease for a physical premises.
* Specifically works with vulnerable people like children, disabled individuals, or the elderly. 
* Offers formal counseling, education, tutoring, and other professional services. 
* Wants to hold special \(offline\) events involving large numbers of people \(e.g. a conference or fun run\) or dangerous materials \(e.g. hazardous waste cleanup, industrial tools\).
* Driving vehicles to carry out initiative activities.

### How much does it cost?

The cost varies widely depending on the nature and scale of the activities to be covered, however getting an addendum to our policies is much cheaper than getting your own standalone policy \(which most initiatives can't do as unincorporated entities\). If an initiative wants insurance, OCF will get a cost quote from our provider and run it by the initiative before committing.
