# Virtual Cards Policy

{% hint style="success" %}
As of October 25, virtual cards are back up and running. [Reach out to us](../../about/contact-us.md) if you have any issues.
{% endhint %}

Virtual Cards can now be issued to OCF’s hosted initiatives for paying things like: recurring payments, online resources/tools, subscriptions that can be paid by card, vendors (e.g. wholesale distributors).&#x20;

## How it works

* Funds are spent only as transactions occur. (Setting up a card does not remove any money from your initiative's budget.)
* Each card will be locked to the first vendor the purchase is made to.  OCF Admins & Initiative Admins agree upon and set the card either at a weekly/monthly limit (for recurring payments) or it can be single-use as well.&#x20;
* As of right now (while we are beta-testing this feature), each initiative can have up to 10 cards assigned.
* Cards have a maximum budget of $1,250/card.

### **Requirements/Policy:**

* For recurring card payments, Initiative budget must be >10x the max of the card
* Initiatives must have a minimum of 2 admin members
* Card must be used solely for the intended vendor initially described to OCF admin (see Steps below)
* _If you need to input Cardholder contact details:_
  * **Name**: You can use yours
  * **Address**: You can use ours:&#x20;
    * 340 S. Lemon Avenue, #3717 Walnut, CA 91789-2706
  * If the transaction requires a shipping address, you may want to use a billing address in the same city&#x20;

#### **Limitations:**

* Virtual cards **may not **be used for paying/reimbursing people-that should be done on the OC platform.
* The following service providers **do not** accept virtual cards:
  * Google **does not** accept prepaid credit cards as a form of payment (e.g. virtuals cards may not be used for Google Workspace, Google Domain.)
  * Money transfer services like PayPal, Payoneer or Paysend. Attempts to pay for services via these providers will be declined.
  * Zipcar
* These are **virtual **cards,** no physical card will be issued**

## Steps:

#### Setup the card:

1. Initiative admins request the card from OCF
   1. Visit your initiative's page
   2. Click Actions -> Request a Card
2. OCF will assign the card and ask the following (please allow time for processing):
   1. **What is the card for? **(The card will be locked to one vendor)
   2. **What is the amount/frequency requested?** (The cards can be set be set: per month, per year, per transaction, total amount, or single-use. For recurring card payments, your initiative’s budget should be >10x more than the monthly balance of the card)
   3. **Which of your initiative's admins would you like to be responsible for the card?**
3. Once assigned, the card's details will appear in the initiative's settings for you to use (in accordance with this policy)

#### ​After a purchase is made:

1. The funds will be withdrawn from your initiative,&#x20;
2. An "Invitation to submit an expense" will be sent to your initiative admins&#x20;
   1. Admins will be asked to submit your receipt. **(If the receipt is not submitted within 30 days, the card access will be paused until you do submit the receipt).**
