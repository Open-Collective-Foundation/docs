### **Nonprofit Rates & Discounts** <a href="#nonprofit-rates" id="nonprofit-rates"></a>

Through OCF’s 501(c)(3) status, our Collectives are eligible for a variety of nonprofit rates and benefits. Don’t forget to inquire to vendors and venues about a possible discount.\
\
**PLEASE NOTE:** Sales tax exemption rules differ across all 50 states and sometimes municipalities. Therefore, this is not an area where OCF can support projects in accessing and we recommend you seek the support of a local fiscal sponsor where this support is required.

### **Google Workspace**

We can set up free Google Workspace accounts for you if you have a domain name. [Learn more](emails.md).

### **Techsoup**

TechSoup has expressed that [discounts through TechSoup do NOT extend to fiscally hosted projects](https://www.techsoup.org/support/product-donation-faq#collapse3-4). While collectives cannot pursue a standalone account for discount purchases, we are part of a pilot program allowing groups to access a limited catalog. Please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/5ky7CXzyYpybhHNh9) to express interest in joining the pilot offering.

### **Slack**

[Slack for Nonprofits](https://slack.com/help/articles/204368833-Apply-for-the-Slack-for-Nonprofits-discount) may offer a substantial discount or free instance for fiscally hosted projects which provide our [MOU (Memorandum of Understanding)](../faq/grants-faq.md#where-can-we-get-an-mou-memorandum-of-understanding).&#x20;

### Loomio

In partnership with Loomio, we are able to offer groups hosted by Open Collective Foundation free access to the platform for their group. To enable this service, groups should complete the following steps.

1. Create a group on Loomio using the steps outlined [here](https://help.loomio.com/en/user\_manual/groups/starting\_a\_group/index.html).
2. Complete the [signup form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetp4H9FiSFhgw-z\_2qo1ON9YSh-9lINn3IBYC0kj9nNl5log/viewform) to tell OCF some details about your Loomio group.
3. OCF will connect your Loomio group to our subscription which should eliminate trial notifications.
