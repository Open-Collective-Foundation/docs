# Other Grants

## Grants to 501(c)(3) public charities

If you would like to make a contribution to another 501(c)(3) public charity aligned with your Collective's mission, we need only review their IRS Determination Letter. Have the organization submit an expense and attach their 501(c)(3) IRS determination letter to the expense.

### Grantmaking programs with only charity recipients

We are happy to work with you to develop a grantmaking program that meets your needs. Your Collective will take the lead on applications and reports, but if you develop any agreements related to your program, we will need to be involved. [Reach out](../../about/contact-us.md) to tak this through.

## Taxable grants to other entities

It is sometimes appropriate for Collectives to distribute grants aligned non-charities with their mission but that do not meet the requirements outlined in the OCF [Grantmaking Policy](policy.md). These sorts of distributions are only allowed on a **case-by-case basis**. Please [reach out to us](../../about/contact-us.md) to discuss if your Collective's mission does not fit with the aforementioned policy.
