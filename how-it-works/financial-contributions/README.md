# Financial Contributions (How to Donate)

Open Collective Foundation allows donors to support amazing Collectives without them having to go through the laborious process of setting up a legal entity and bank account to receive funds.

While Open Collective Foundation provides [plenty of benefits](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/what-we-offer) for our sponsored Collectives, there are also benefits for financial contributors. Since our hosted Collectives use [the Open Collective platform](https://opencollective.com/foundation#section-contributions), their finances are transparent, and you can feel confident that the funds will be put to good use.

Since we have 501(c)(3) status with the IRS, **financial contributions are tax-deductible to the extent of the law.** Once received we will issue a receipt that certifies that you have made this charitable contribution and you are not receiving any goods or services in return.

If you value what a project produces or stands for, support them to maintain and grow it! You can also be recognized by appearing on their page as a financial contributor.

### Donors can contribute via the following methods:

* [Credit Card, Paypal, and Electronic Bank Transfer](credit-card-paypal-bank-transfers.md)
* [Check](checks.md)
* [Donor-Advised Fund](dafs.md)
* [Matching Gift](donation-matching.md)
* [In-Kind (i.e., “non-cash”)](in-kind.md)
* [Stock donations](stock-donations.md)
* [Other ways to donate](other-ways-to-give.md)

Further instructions on how to support one of our hosted Collectives via the above methods are included below. See [Official Information and Documents](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/official-information-and-documents) for our EIN, determination letter, and banking info.

{% hint style="info" %}
No matter which method you choose, make sure to whenever possible, **indicate the Collective** that you would like to support. If your chosen contribution method does not provide you with any opportunity to do so (e.g., there is no memo line, accompanying letter, or online form) [please reach out to us to let us know](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) the details of the transaction so we know to expect it and properly credit it when the funds arrive.
{% endhint %}

#### Thank you!

On behalf of our Collectives, thank you for your support! We highly value all of our contributors. If there is anything you need as a donor, please [reach out](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation).
