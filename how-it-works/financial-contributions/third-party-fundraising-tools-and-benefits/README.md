# Third-Party Fundraising Tools and Benefits

Although [receiving funds through the Open Collective platform](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions) is the swiftest, most direct & efficient way to receive funds, OCF’s hosted initiatives can also use some third-party tools to receive funds for their initiative.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be sure to review our [**Outside Entities Policy**](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/outside-entities-policy) and [**Outside Accounts Policy**](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/outside-accounts-policy) before moving forward with any of these options&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Note:**

* You must [reach out to us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) if you decide to use one of these third-party platforms. We may already have an account on the platform, in which case we will help you get things set up. It will also speed up the process of getting the funds into your budget.
* Since you are part of Open Collective Foundation, funds will need to go directly to us and then we’ll make sure they go into your initiative’s budget.
* Since moving funds from these sites into your balance is a manual process, and due to external platforms’ own unique disbursement processes, the funds will not reach you as quickly as those raised through Open Collective. There will likely be delays.
* OCF will charge [our standard fee](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/fees) on funds raised on the external sites.

## Third-Party Tools

The below tools have been used by Open Collective Foundation's initiatives in the past and send us information about which initiative the funds are for.&#x20;

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Benevity" %}

_Note_: funds raised from Benevity are disbursed to us on a monthly basis.

{% hint style="info" %}
We will set up your Benevity profile using the information & logo you use on your OC page. If there is alternative/additional information you would like to present, please be sure to specify and we will be sure to include it.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The following are **not** set up to work specifically with fiscally hosted projects and do not report where donated funds are meant to be allocated to.  This means there will be delays in the funds arriving to your account.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**If you wish to have the raised funds from the below platforms allocated to your fund, you must **[**inform us**](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation)** about the incoming funds (please include links + screenshots). **Unclaimed funds will be directed to OCF's operating costs.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Facebook" %}
[Facebook Fundraisers](https://www.facebook.com/fund/Open-Collective-Foundation-100612854999717/)

1. Use [this link](https://www.facebook.com/fund/Open-Collective-Foundation-100612854999717/) to setup a Facebook Fundraiser with Open Collective as the recipient
2. [Contact us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) when you start a new fundraiser so that we can get the raised funds correctly allocated to your account
3. :exclamation: Due to Facebook's disbursement schedule, there could be a \~1 month delay in disbursement of raised funds to your initiative after the Facebook fundraiser has ended. Funds arrive from Facebook in batches, so it is unlikely OCF received your fundraising campaign's money all at once.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="GoFundMe" %}
GoFundMe [Charity Fundraising](https://www.gofundme.com/start/charity-fundraising)

* Select OpenCollective Foundation as the beneficiary in order for your donors to receive tax-deductible status \[recommended],&#x20;
* **or **you collect them on your own behalf, and transfer them to your initiative as one lump sum. \[it will not be tax-deductible for your donors]
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If you use any of these tools, **please **[**email us**](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation). Also, [let us know](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) if you are interested in a platform not listed above and we will see if we can make it work.

{% hint style="warning" %}
[Please email us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) if you are expecting a payment from the third party service so we can look out for it and credit your account.
{% endhint %}

#### External PayPal Accounts

Since initiatives can receive and spend funds via PayPal from within the Open Collective platform, you **should not** set up an external PayPal account for receiving or spending funds. Please review our [**Outside Accounts Policy**](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/outside-accounts-policy)** **for more details.

#### Amazon Smile

Unfortunately, OCF cannot direct funds received from Amazon Smile to specific hosted initiatives. Initiatives should not use Amazon Smile to raise money for their work.

### **Venmo and Cash App**

Unfortunately, Venmo, Cash App, and other similar services we are aware of do not currently allow nonprofit accounts. Therefore, your initiative cannot send (or receive) funds from these sources directly through Open Collective.

In the situation where bank transfer and PayPal are not viable transfer methods, an individual on your team can send funds to the intended recipient via one of these services and then submit for reimbursement.&#x20;

In the **Reimbursement**, make sure to include:&#x20;

* [ ] the **name **of the indirect recipient of the funds and&#x20;
* [ ] **what they are using those funds for**,&#x20;
* [ ] if available, the **receipt**(s) for their activities,&#x20;
* [ ] as well as the **receipt **from the service (e.g. Venmo) that you used to transfer them the funds.

{% hint style="info" %}
**All **funds for your initiative **must **be held in your budget with Open Collective Foundation. Read about the [limitations of our fiscal hosting service](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations), as well as our [Outside Accounts Policy](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/outside-accounts-policy). If you would like to make direct cash payments out to recipients, please review our [Cash Assistance Policy](../../policies/cash-assistance-policy.md).
{% endhint %}

## Third-Party Benefits

{% hint style="success" %}
Refer to** **[**our Official Information & Documentation**](../../../about/official-information-and-documents.md) if a third-party tool asks you for it (e.g. address, EIN, bank info, 990s)
{% endhint %}

### **Nonprofit Rates & Discounts** <a href="nonprofit-rates" id="nonprofit-rates"></a>

Through OCF’s 501(c)(3) status, our initiatives are eligible for a variety of nonprofit rates and benefits. Don’t forget to inquire to vendors and venues about a possible discount!&#x20;

Keep in mind that nonprofit rates are not a legal process. It's up to the vendor's discretion whether or not they offer initiatives a nonprofit rate.

### **Google Workspace**

[Reach out to us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) if you would like to create a Google for Nonprofits or Google Workspace (a.k.a. G Suite) account for your initiative.

#### **Techsoup**

Techsoup has expressed that [discounts through TechSoup do NOT extend to fiscally hosted projects](https://www.techsoup.org/support/product-donation-faq#collapse3-4).

#### **Slack**

Slack offers discounts through TechSoup, and Techsoup is not compatible with fiscal hosting.

## Donation Matching

OCF can process matching donations (including employee giving programs, matching gifts, contributions-matching, funds arriving from third-party giving platforms, and grant matches), but in order to do so, we need additional information about the donation.&#x20;

**To ensure that a donation match goes through, please **[**email us**](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.foundation)** the following:  **

* [ ] Donor name
* [ ] Donor company/employer name
* [ ] Initiative name
* [ ] Date(s) of original donation (if in two parts)
* [ ] Dollar amount of original donation
* [ ] The match amount or rate (i.e., 2x, 3x, 4x)
* [ ] If known, the platform used by the company/employer

Without the above information, we cannot guarantee that funds will be allocated properly and in a timely manner. This is due to the difficult manual processes required in order to correctly allocate those funds.&#x20;

If needed, you can find our **EIN number** on the [Official Information and Documents page](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/official-information-and-documents). Any email communications from your matching gift program should go to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation).&#x20;

If you are expecting funds and have not seen them arrive, or if you have donated funds via third-parties, please [email us at contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:%20contact@opencollective.com) with the above information included and we will be happy to locate and allocate those funds with you.
