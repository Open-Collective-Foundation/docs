# Virtual Cards Policy

{% hint style="success" %}
OCF is in the process of changing virtual card providers.  Details for new processes are below. Please understand these are new for us, so there may be some challenges that arise along the way. For any very important/urgent expense, please use our [normal expense processes](../payouts.md).
{% endhint %}

Virtual Cards can be issued to OCF’s hosted initiatives for paying things like: recurring payments, online resources/tools, subscriptions that can be paid by card, vendors (e.g. wholesale distributors).&#x20;

## How it works

* Funds are spent only as transactions occur. (Setting up a card does not remove any money from your initiative's budget.)
* Card limits are automatically linked to your initiative's budget. (This means overspending on the card is not possible).
* Cards will be issued with a $1000/month budget.
* If more than $1000/month is required, please request additional cards.
* Cards must be used in compliance with our policy below

## **Requirements/Policy:**

* Initiatives must have a minimum of 2 admin members
* These are **virtual cards.** No physical card will be issued, so these likely cannot be used in-store.
* Cards can be used for paying things like recurring payments, online resources/tools, any subscription you are paying for with a card, vendors (e.g. wholesale distributors).&#x20;

**Limitations:**

* Virtual cards **may not** be used for paying/reimbursing people-that should be done on the OC platform.
* These are **virtual** cards, **no physical card will be issued**

#### If you need to input Cardholder contact details:

* **Name**: You can use yours
* **Address**: You can use ours:&#x20;
  * 340 S. Lemon Avenue, #3717 Walnut, CA 91789-2706
* _If the transaction requires a shipping address, you may want to use a billing address in the same city_&#x20;

## Steps:

#### Setup the card:

1. Initiative admins request the card from OCF
   1. Visit your initiative's page
   2. Click Actions -> Request a Card
2. OCF will assign the card (please allow time for processing)
3. Once assigned, admin will be notified via email and the card's details will appear in the initiative's settings for you to use (in accordance with this policy)

#### ​After a purchase is made:

1. The funds will be withdrawn from your initiative,&#x20;
2. An "Invitation to submit an expense" will be sent to your initiative admins&#x20;
   1. Admins will be asked to submit your receipt. **(If the receipt is not submitted within 30 days, the card access will be paused until you do submit the receipt).**
