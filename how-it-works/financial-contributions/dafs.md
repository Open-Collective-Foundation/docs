# Donor Advised Funds (DAF)

A **donor advised fund **is a centralized charitable account that helps individuals, families, and businesses to efficiently distribute their charitable contributions.&#x20;

The donor gives to a fund which is hosted by a charity (such as [Fidelity Charitable](https://www.fidelitycharitable.org)) or their local community foundation. That entity will then distribute the funds to charities, as advised by the donor.

Technically, the organization hosting the fund has full discretion of the use of the funds. In practice, the donors control how the funds they contributed to the donor advised fund are distributed. There are benefits to donors who use such a fund, but we’ll leave all that to your tax advisor.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since an individual’s donation is technically sent to the donor advised fund (not the charities such as Open Collective Foundation) it supports, Open Collective Foundation’s tax receipts will be addressed to the DAF rather than the donor who directs the contribution.

## Donating from a DAF

Every donor advised fund ([what’s that?](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions/dafs)) has a slightly different process!

* **If your fund can contribute via electronic bank transfer,** please ask them to [initiate a contribution](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments) via the initiative’s page. This is much faster than by check. Should you have the option of having them send an email notification for the transaction, please have it sent to [contact@opencollective.foundation](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation).
* **If your fund needs to contribute via check**, please feel free to provide them with [our mailing address](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/about/official-information-and-documents#address). The check should be made out to Open Collective Foundation - NOT the name of the initiative you intend to support.

No matter which method they use, when you initiate the contribution, please make sure to **include the name of the initiative as the “designation” for this gift** or include it in another available comments or notes field.

Most donor-advised funds are familiar with fiscal sponsorship, but if they have any questions, please feel free to [direct them to us](mailto:contact@opencollective.foundation) and we will be happy to fill them in.
