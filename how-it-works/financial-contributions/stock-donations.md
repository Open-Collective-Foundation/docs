# Stock Donations

Open Collective Foundation is able to receive donations of public stock on behalf of hosted initiatives.&#x20;

### Tax benefits

Normally when you sell stock, you have to pay capital gains tax. But if you donate it to a tax-exempt nonprofit, it can be sold tax-free. So everyone wins: the donor gets tax benefits, and the initiative gets a donation to support its mission.

### How it works

1. The owner of the public stock transfers it to OCF
2. OCF sells the stock as soon as it comes in
3. The proceeds are credited to the initiative's balance

No, OCF is only able to accept public stock that can be immediately sold on the market.
