# Virtual Cards Policy

{% hint style="danger" %}
As of October 11, 2021, virtual cards for Open Collective Foundation initiatives are currently **on pause**. This is due to issues with our card provider. We are working hard to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Reach out to us with any questions.
{% endhint %}

Virtual Cards can now be issued to OCF’s hosted initiatives for paying things like: recurring payments, online resources/tools, subscriptions that can be paid by card, vendors (e.g. wholesale distributors). 

## How it works

* Funds are spent only as transactions occur. (Setting up a card does not remove any money from your initiative's budget.)
* Each card will be locked to the first vendor the purchase is made to.  OCF Admins & Initiative Admins agree upon and set the card either at a weekly/monthly limit (for recurring payments) or it can be single-use as well. 
* As of right now (while we are beta-testing this feature), each initiative can have up to 10 cards assigned.
* Cards have a maximum budget of $1,250/card.

### **Requirements/Policy:**

* For recurring card payments, Initiative budget must be >10x the max of the card
* Initiatives must have a minimum of 2 admin members
* Card must be used solely for the intended vendor initially described to OCF admin (see Steps below)
* _If you need to input Cardholder contact details:_
  * **Name**: You can use yours
  * **Address**: You can use ours: 
    * 340 S. Lemon Avenue, #3717 Walnut, CA 91789-2706
  * If the transaction requires a shipping address, you may want to use a billing address in the same city 

#### **Limitations:**

* Virtual cards **may not **be used for paying/reimbursing people-that should be done on the OC platform.
* The following service providers **do not** accept virtual cards:
  * Google **does not** accept prepaid credit cards as a form of payment (e.g. virtuals cards may not be used for Google Workspace, Google Domain.)
  * Money transfer services like PayPal, Payoneer or Paysend. Attempts to pay for services via these providers will be declined.
  * Zipcar
* These are **virtual **cards,** no physical card will be issued**

## Steps:

#### Setup the card:

1. Initiative admins request the card from OCF
   1. Visit your initiative's page
   2. Click Actions -> Request a Card
2. OCF will assign the card and ask the following (please allow time for processing):
   1. **What is the card for? **(The card will be locked to one vendor)
   2. **What is the amount/frequency requested?** (The cards can be set be set: per month, per year, per transaction, total amount, or single-use. For recurring card payments, your initiative’s budget should be >10x more than the monthly balance of the card)
   3. **Which of your initiative's admins would you like to be responsible for the card?**
3. Once assigned, the card's details will appear in the initiative's settings for you to use (in accordance with this policy)

#### ​After a purchase is made:

1. The funds will be withdrawn from your initiative, 
2. An "Invitation to submit an expense" will be sent to your initiative admins 
   1. Admins will be asked to submit your receipt. **(If the receipt is not submitted within 30 days, the card access will be paused until you do submit the receipt).**
