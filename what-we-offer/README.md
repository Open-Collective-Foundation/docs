# What We Offer

## We Got You

You shouldn't have to incorporate a legal entity, start a new bank account, and set up bookkeeping just to collect and spend money for a project—and with Open Collective Foundation you don't have to.

We are a [501(c)(3)](fiscal-hosting.md#what-does-501-c-3-mean) organization specializing in technology-driven, Comprehensive (Model A) fiscal hosting ([what’s that?](fiscal-hosting.md)) for collaborative initiatives, groups, and communities. We can be your legal entity and provide you with the financial tools you need to make an impact on the world! No bank account required.

### **Nonprofit Status**

Open Collective Foundation is a [501(c)(3) organization](fiscal-hosting.md#what-does-501-c-3-mean), meaning our hosted Collectives are charitable projects that can receive **tax-deductible donations**.

This arrangement is perfect for charitable projects that want to move fast and reduce setup costs, especially since incorporating an entity and getting 501(c)(3) status can take over a year, requires a lot of admin to run, and likely requires hiring an accountant and a lawyer.

Further, hosted Collectives have access to one of the biggest benefits of 501(c)(3) status: being able to **apply for special grants from foundations**. _Most major foundations, along with many companies, will only contribute to 501(c)(3) organizations and their sponsored Collectives._ Make sure you take this into account when considering the best fit for your project or community!

### **Tax Compliance**

Open Collective Foundation will take care of your Collective's tax filings and compliance requirements.

Open Collective Foundation [issues 1099s to contracted workers when required](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/tax-information#for-us-based-fiscal-hosts), provides donors with receipts for their tax-deductible contributions, and files an [annual Form 990](../about/official-information-and-documents.md#irs-form-990s) to the IRS on behalf of all of our hosted Collectives.

### Services & Community

In addition to being your legal and financial home, OCF offers many useful services to its community, and works to connect our Collectives together in solidarity.
