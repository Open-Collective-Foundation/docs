## Not Required

Here are things that are not required by Open Collective Foundation that are sometimes requested by other fiscal sponsors:

* No application fees.
* No yearly flat fee (only a small percentage fee on funds raised)
* No minimum budget balance.
* No minimum amount you have to raise per year.
* No duration requirement (You can [leave ](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/closing-a-collective)Open Collective at any time)
* No onerous application process, just [a few straightforward questions](how-to-apply/application-questions.md).
* No intense reporting requirements (the [platform automates that](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/budget)!) other than posting a straightforward annual [Update](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/communication#updates) to your Collective page.

Open Collective is a **home** for your community or collaborative charitable project - no matter how much money comes in.

{% hint style="info" %}
If accepted to be hosted by Open Collective Foundation, any raised funds are now part of the 501(c)(3) space and must remain in it. This mean if you ever want to transition away from OCF or [close your account](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/faq#what-is-the-process-for-leaving-open-collective-foundation), the funds will either need to be disbursed to the community or transferred to other 501(c)(3)s.
