# Basics

{% hint style="success" %}
Once you [apply to join Open Collective Foundation](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/getting-started/how-to-apply) and receive an approval email from us, you can immediately get started with managing your initiative on Open Collective. 

üéâ Welcome! 
{% endhint %}

## Open Collective 

{% hint style="info" %}
* **Open Collective Inc**. is the **platform** that OCF operates on. 
  * Open Collective has their own [homepage](www.opencollective.com), [budget](https://opencollective.com/opencollective#category-ABOUT), and [documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/). These docs are a pared down version to relay information that is specific to OCF.
* **OCF \(**Open Collective **Foundation\)** is a charitable ****[**fiscal host**](../about/what-we-offer/fiscal-hosting.md) who uses the Open Collective platform
{% endhint %}

For an overview of [using the Open Collective platform](https://opencollective.com/how-it-works), check out their[ documentation](https://docs.opencollective.com/). It has a ton of great information about features like the [transparent budget](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/budget), customizing an [initiative profile](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/customize-collective), [tiers, goals](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/tiers-goals), and other tools now at your disposal. 

‚úÖ Their [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/quick-start-guide) is another great place to start.

## Receiving Funds

Our documentation includes information for how people can contribute to your initiative: Feel free to share this [Financial Contributions overview](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/financial-contributions) with your contributors!

## Submitting Expenses

Using funds from your initiative‚Äôs budget is simple:

1. Someone submits an [expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses).
2. An initiative [admin ](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/core-contributors#roles)\(someone on your team\) approves it.
3. OCF's team reviews it \(confirms that the expense meets requirements e.g. having a valid receipt\).
4. They get [paid](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/payouts#what-payment-methods-do-you-support-for-withdrawals).

{% hint style="info" %}
Initiative admins can [set an expense policy](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/expense-policy) to give guidance to expense submitters. 
{% endhint %}

### How submitting & paying out expenses works:

**Expense** payments may relate to either: an **invoice** for work completed for the initiative; or **reimbursement** for purchases made on behalf of the initiative.

{% hint style="success" %}
* Individuals and organizations can request payment from an initiative by [submitting an expense](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses). 
* Initiative admins also have the option of drafting an expense and then [sending an invitation to someone else to complete and submit it](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses#inviting-a-third-party-to-submit-an-expense).
  * _This is a great option for those admins who know already know exactly how much they want to pay/reimburse someone, and just want to invite them to the platform._
{% endhint %}

#### OCF uses a Double-Approval Process to pay out expenses: 

1. Once submitted, expenses need to first be [approved by initiative admins](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/collectives/approving-expenses) and then,
2. Expenses are processed and paid out by Open Collective Foundation biweekly \(on **Mondays and Thursdays**\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
OCF can [pay out funds](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses#by-what-method-can-i-get-paid) via PayPal and electronic bank transfer via Transferwise. 

Make sure to review the [Expenses and Getting Paid](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/expenses) section of Open Collective‚Äôs documentation for a full overview of the process.

If your initiative would like to pay out funds to individuals who do not have bank account access/PayPal, please review our [Cash Assistance Policy](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/processes-and-limitations/cash-assistance-policy).

Also check our [Third-Party Fundraising Tools](third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits/) and our [Outside Accounts Policy](processes-and-limitations/outside-accounts-policy.md) pages for info about how OCF works with other giving platforms \(e.g. [Venmo, CashApp,](third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits/#venmo-and-cash-app) [GoFundMe](third-party-fundraising-tools-and-benefits/#third-party-tools)\)
